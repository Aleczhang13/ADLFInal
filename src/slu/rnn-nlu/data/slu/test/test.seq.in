this is the hallmark of our in singapore .
then this merlion there are altogether five .

this is not hard to find it .
you can take the subway or , er , if you say you live in . for example , this , from singapore to chinatown .
if it 's chinatown ?
er , it 's easy to get over this side .
it 's half a leo , half of the fish .
the fish tail moines singapore is four side are all the sea . and we used to the people of the fish to make a living .
in the early stage , curlier . it 's because there is a prince from sumatra over there .
when he came over here , i saw a lion .
just pull them change name for singapore .
the classical chinese literature , it is new to add a leo .
it 's a slope pulled city .
so the lion city roped in singapore .
singapore is from the name of the old translated .
then if you go to a outlying island . it 's called shengtao narrow-leaved to go about it ?
er , you can see it 's also saw the lion 's , um ,
er , leo . like this .
but it is very big .
there are altogether five .
er , you wait a minute , i 'll see a more a slightly bigger one .
this is also merlion .
it 's probably also , in a outlying island .
in an outlying island .
in an island , called shengtao of excrement .

do you know ?
not too sure ?
i 'll find a better one for you .
but it 's just that there are six .

this outlying island called shengtao excrement .

then you just use the cable car from the place .
come over this shengtao excrement .
it 's just over here .

then this .
it ' s the place where i can have fun on the island of very much . for example , er , this butterfly with an insect gyms .

% er , we , it will turn down at six . so do n't you can go at night .
it 's so , during the day .
you can see it very clearly from the top during the day .
{ lips are loud }
there are still some other places , % oh .
% uh { lips are loud } .
now i can show you are looking for .
that is , % ah , this .
this seems to be a ferris wheel .
it ' s about ten minutes , - seven ten minutes or so .
going up and down .
probably to the office ] [ bump hat . it will be in the slot at the over there .
in that case , you can see the whole here in singapore .
very good .
do you have you seen it ?
uh-huh .
er , now i can show you a picture of looking for a lift .
because it ' s going to be the island , you can choose to use the cable car . you can take the bus .
uh-huh .
er .
you can sit in the past , er , use a small train can also come over .
now you can see the pictures of the lift ?
uh-huh .
it 's about ten minutes or so .
from the top of the mountain .
from the top of the hill over there in the past .
it ' s probably a little five hundred kilometers .
it 's in the middle , it has a place over there . it is possible to stop for a while .
but it will continue .
uh-huh .
you can .
you can .
the lift is it big enough for eight adults .
in fact , this is the new lift , because when i was about two years ago . change all those old .
so this is fairly large .
you can sit eight people .
twenty-four dollars s $ .
it 's twenty eight for the round trip .
if it 's just a little more worth it back and forth .
in the end the lift it 's eleven eleven o'clock in the evening .
it probably at eight o'clock in the morning .
uh-huh .
now you see this is another facilities .
this young man likes to play .
there i saw on the screen ?
ah , right .
this
this is called luge in english .
it seems as if you just take that small car sliding down the hill .
there 's no danger ] [ did n't did n't dangerous .
{ lips are } rings because you are playing before . it will be , i 'll teach you how to control .
so i more or less if she ca n't do n't you ~ ~ [ ] if you do n't go too fast . [ ] still it 's ok .
[ wo n't do n't directely ]
% uh .
{ lips are loud }
to glide down , then you hang around and come back % of the hoist it .
have you seen the picture ?
oh .
you go on to the next
in that case .
the speed you control myself .
ah ? would you like it can be soon .
you can also slow .
as long as you go straight ahead , that is .
uh-huh .
this is also one of one of them , you can go to see it .
there are still some three-dimensional movies , ah , um , three d ? d and there are four .
there are still some on the beach .
uh-huh .
i 'll give you look at the pictures .
the island , that is , er ,
yea , and it is one of the latest , that is ,

it 's just that i fly .
that is the one you can fly .
it seemed to be in , genting highland .
ah , did you see it now ? ?
oh , i have n't .
oh , i see .
that is , er , right .
this is the latest that is near the opening of the yesterady .
it seems that it 's parachute , but there was no parachute .
then you can fly to go inside . i just got up .
the space it wo n't be too big , it 's just very high .
it wo n't take you touted to go to the place where is very high .
uh-huh .
this is relatively more young people like it .
usually you need two hours , because over there he will teach you how to control it .
and then you 'll have to change clothes and something like that .
so i 'm going to have to take at least two hours .
if it is , if it 's like animals or bird .
it can also go to the seaside .
there are some program at the seaside .
for example , the birds of the performance .
you 'll see a design . that 's it .

er , i also have a snake .
and this is a monkey .
you can feed it , it 's birds . you can buy some food to feed it .

well , if you go back to this , if the city ?
there are also { lips loud } city ~ ~ [ ] a lot of places to go shopping .

another one is that the malay . i wanfujing .
can this [ three ] these scenic spots . now you can see that there are no one . i saw a street ?
% uh , this is little india .
little india .
why is noise from { } little india ?
because there are a lot of people in the place to live in india .
and they usually have to buy some relish . or they % ah , some of the material .
it 's all come to this place .
[ ] it it it is not a very big . so it 's little india .
{ lips are loud }
it 's a long street . but both sides of the street is just like this in the house .
there 's a lot of this kind of small stores .

it 's just that there are some inside it .
and then there is one was outside , it 's just this one .

yes , there is .
the subway station is near .
it 's also called chinatown subway station .
this , you can use the internet to check it out .
it 's eighty one . hotel
uh-huh .
go to live there .
leave from the other side do you start ?
or are you looking for a travel agency until after this side ?
that 's fine .
ok .
then you have to go to your travel agency .
you over there , it will help you make arrangements for the travel agency .
it 's just the itinerary will probably be a little more pressing .
if you come here , you can say that .
the flowering of his own that you are interested .
i still have that your time .
you can take your time .
it has its advantages .
that 's right .
you do n't need to worry about that .
help you arrange it all .
the car to pick them up , and there is a tour guide and so on and so forth .
all the help you arrange it .
the only thing is just that time , do n't you can control .
about four days .
on the last day of the guests are usually use the time to go shopping .
uh-huh . right .
it ' s four days .
in that case , you might be in one day .
shengtao narrow-leaved roamed around it .
because you need a day .
let 's just look at other scenic spots .
ah .
or ,
to go .
for us .
i have told you before , we have two for the zoo ?
yes , it does .
you can go to the zoo or at night to the zoo .
is it possible to get birds park .
usually it 's guests are taking advantage of the last day or so that time to go shopping .
you said it was your own now ?
right .
you do n't have to do with this right on the tour ?
then
right .
then you have to arrange for your , uh , the itinerary .
for example , if you arrive at noon . we are in singapore .
then you can start your journey .
or you 'll arrive in the evening then i can only go and see the clarke quay .
this can be arranged by myself .
in short , that you have probably .
there are at least two days , about two and half days .
that , more or less .
because the area of singapore is n't say it is very large .
then you have to put that mainly to look at it , it will be fine .
some people do n't like to go to the zoo , so i do n't necessarily have to go to the zoo .
you can only go there on time .
because it over there in the north . the one in singapore .
it 's just a little bit far away , it is relatively far from the downtown area , a little bit .
is there anything else you 'd like to know about it ?
the cost of living is the standard .
it has , high-end .
there are also regular , please .

peddler center to go for a meal .
a meal .
just one person 's consumption .
probably s $ 4 yuan .
it 's ok for four dollars .
this is a peddler centres .
in that case , for example , do you want a little more spenders
in the hotel ?
some hotels in the restaurant .

it 's another matter .
but , in general , that is , in peddler centres
everyone can just eat a meal , fourty nz .
there are n't many four nz for us here .
uh-huh .
you over there it into the sixth .
into the sixth .
twenty-four dollars , it 's like that .
right .
this is usually on this side .
security is still considered to be very good .
it 's pretty good .
there will be no problem .
and even , oh .
for example , it seems we women after we get off work .
it 's also very safe when i go home .
uh-huh .
that is ,
it does n't matter .
it 's still very safe .
that 's right .
do n't just telling you to cause trouble .
right , % uh .
for example , the personal is purely [ to ] go to go and have fun .
that ' s no problem .
there are % .
it 's just gave it to you to see that clarke quay % .
it 's over there .
% uh .
right , all the rallying .
therefore , it will be very lively in the evening .
there 's a bar very much .
% uh .

this is a interchange .
then you just have to sit in on this side of the red line .
you just change the purple come again .
here is not clarke quay now .
right this way , ah .
this place .
right .
then you just in , for example , if you live in chinatown . you just need to be in the room next door .
it 's very close to that .
uh-huh .
by taxi .
right .
that 's the fastest % .
right .
then you from the most % from the machine . er [ from ] to ride from the airport to the clarke quay .
it was probably s $ 25 dollars .
there are , % ah , there are .
three dollars , that some of them are three dollars and twenty-five cents .
but it seems like it 's from the airport to pay more for five dollars .
five dollars right .
because the time you have to wait for the guests at the airport .
because they are lining up for % .
then they may sometimes % standing in two hours .
and then there is an extra charge % of the matter . it 's s $ five dollars .
% uh .
you can continue to ask other problems .

if you have a s $ er probably over one thousand dollars .
it 's just about six thousand yuan rmb .
it should be fine .
enough .
if you do n't go to those places high-end er for dinner .
yes , there is no problem .
for example , if you want to eat a meal .
oh , in a lot of that on this side of the peddler centres .
peddler center .
one person may come down to eat a meal . s $ fourty dollars .
so , just six multiplied by 24 yuan . your place on the other side of the renminbi .
that 's enough .
that 's enough .
uh-huh .
right .
er , it 's just that you have probably 24 yuan rmb .
it has already been fine .
of course , if you want to go to that some relatively high-end that some of the restaurant in the hotel .
that is , of course , it 's possible .
but generally , that is .
we are just ordinary people in singapore .
usually it ' s dine out there .
for dinner , it 's time for lunch .
i wo n't go back home .
do n't go home , because i still at work .
that will probably go there for lunch time to peddler center
fourty dollars can be resolved .
four .
the four one two three four .
four dollars .
right .
then you multiplied by six , it 's just that you have the other side 24 yuan .
right ?
oh , right .
in that case , you probably have a concept , right ?
it ' s better than
i understand what you are saying .
it 's not so expensive .
uh-huh .
so , what do you want to buy ?
what do you want to buy ?
uh-huh , heh .
what else ?
do you want to buy a handbag ?
did n't you say that one of the famous brands bag , right ?
oh .
right .
then you just come over this one .
now you see the pictures , oh .
this is one of our chinatown , right ?
that is , if you say you live in this way .
it was eighty one at this hotel .
oh , then after a street
then , i arrow-heads in the office of the place . oh , across the street again
we have that , uh , uh , that is , there are things for sale .
that is , er ,
it seems that it is a pile of , we will buy a lot of stuff
there are also clothes .

uh-huh .
then , this side to buy clothes , it 's very convenient .
because you sell only the summer clothes .
oh , that thick winter clothe of all .
there is no need to .
in that case , you see this one is now . we are one of the singapore .
little india .
in india .
right .
how do you explain that ?
because there are people in india in singapore .
our population is .
five million .
chinese people are seventy six percent .
and then there is a , er , is indian . nine percent .
in that case , the chinese are the chinatown .
that 's also wanted to give a 印度街 for people who are in india .
right ?
this is the only way is fair .
uh-huh .
so , we have a little india on this side .
then you 'll find it .
uh-huh .

now that you are in , i saw one .
a buddha images ?
oh , the buddha , right .
this one is one of the temple .
because there are a lot of it on the side of the temple .
this is one of them .
then , one of them is the temple of the photos .
because , little india buddhist temples are very much .
er ,
this one 's good faith all teach people in india .

then , er , and that 's it .
i 'll give you look at this one .
this one
right .
have you seen it ?
uh-huh .
so , so , it 's , it 's a little india , it ' s about two kilometers .
then it 's on the left hand side , on the right hand side of this kind of small this path .
in that case , you can see a lot of these old-styled .
structures .
yes , there is .
here are some reservations .
because , the country must keep these old-styled of structures .
it is the national treasures .
the assets .
so , here are some keep it .
if you go to chinatown , er ,
if this little india .
they all have this kind of old-styled in the house .
do n't live now .
in the past , this place here there are still many people on the second floor .
there are no people living in now .

there are some overhears , or even seems to be this one .
this should be , it seems that one in the office .
the office building .
oh , right .
this is a little india .
then you come to singapore , then you can come over . this side for shopping , take a look at it .
it 's very special .
in that case , you do n't have to worry about public security area .
because , it 's quite safe here . uh , ok .

there is no matter what .
it 's not too bad .
it 's not too bad .
we 'd better , because we are all on this side of the street .
this is a streetlights in the evening .

looking at it on screen are still very realistic .
then the universal studios also have the roller coaster .

this is only the hotel on the island .
alas .
er ,
moreover , uh , it 's hotel .
it depends on what season .
that 's right .
he was a bit high . when it 's the season .
a little more expensive .
then , when a slightly more qijing , uh , that will make it cheaper .
er ,
no , it also has that rather qijing .
for example , there are some , a certain period they play in the country . there is no public for the holidays .
he would n't have come in singapore .
so it 's a bit more on this side of the qijing .
in fact , this is a yamanoteline now , oh .
er , this 人潮 will be slightly more passengers will take off .
just a little less .
uh-huh .
ah .
now that you will see a group that merlion on screen .
right .

oh , do you have ?
they saw a group of the merlion .
it 's curlier .
right .
the tail of fish .
this was just the island .
it also has a head of the merlion .
but that ca n't spraying of water .
this one , it 's the most important scenic spots .
then you must have come to singapore side over this .
look at this side .
uh-huh .
oh , oh , the name in singapore , because of this
it 's translated it from singapore , up over there .
it is because as far as 传说就 in a long time ago .
er , the prince .
he is from the sumatra over singapore ?
then he , i saw a lion on the island .
he just change the name of the island , pull . in singapore .
new , it 's classical chinese literature , what i mean is , the lion .
it 's a slope pulled city .
right , the lion city .
singapore .
right .
that is , er , a leo wouvenirs on that side .
it 's just to see the lions .
then later i went to this at the generation .
it seemed that on this side , that is what we said there should be a symbolically deformation .
for example , if you go to new york , you will see the statue of liberty right ?
in that case , we just at that time on this side of the painting .
he said to design a , er , the statue . that is the representative of ours , a typical .
one of the chinese people just designed for the merlion .
curlier , because we are a leo city .
the fish is the tail .
we are a small island .
for the week , er , it 's all depend on the sea .
moreover , it was very much at that time , er , in the early stage of that some live on the island of malay .
they are all fish to make a living .
so with the fish .
yeah , right .
so half of the fish .
er , in addition , is the first half of the lions .
uh , uh , i just have a gentleman . he said .
do you have this kind of animals ?
er , no .
this is only one , out of our own design .
he said it was not fiction ?
of course it 's imaginary .
this is not so .
i 've never seen such an animal .
that is , this one is a sign of our singapore .
then after you went to singapore , we must look at this one .
this merlion .

some people said it 's durian .
then in singapore , we usually people in singapore .
oh , when we went to take the taxi
the driver , i asked where are we going ?
we said to durian , the opera house .
he will know about this one place .
then you see that ?
the designer . in fact , when he was in the design of the opera house .
it was originally uh two tablets made of glass .
but later he thought that we wo n't from singapore , the weather is very hot ?
in that case , that in the sun will be lusty into the opera house every day .
he just planking these small that some on it . er , that 's it .
is the role of the sunshine do n't quick-minded . in this one in the opera house .
then later , just like this .
then how about the place , the most difficult . it 's actually want to find someone to go . on the other side .
take this part of the dishcchoths .
usually it ' s necessary to six months ' time .
uh-huh .
at the same time .
right .
six months ' time to wash side .
