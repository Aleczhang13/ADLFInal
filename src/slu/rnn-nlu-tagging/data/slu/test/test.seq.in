malaysian
the country is very big , very mountainous .
therefore ,

and then we just yourself
there has been filtered water works , filtered out , just get to use it .
and , uh , we , er .
with the malaysian buy this water ha .
it 's a contract .

this is difficult to find it .
you can take the subway or , er , if you live in . for instance , singapore in chinatown .
from the chinatown ?
er , it 's easy to get over this side .
uh-huh .
it 's half is leo , half of fish .
the fish tail moines singapore is four side are all into the sea . moreover , our previous people are fish to make a living .
curlier in the early stage , it 's because there is a prince from sumatra over there .
when he came over here , i saw a lion .
just pull them renamed in singapore .
the classical chinese literature , it is the new with a leo .
slope in town .
so the lion city in singapore .
singapore is from the names of the old translated .

then if you go to a outlying island . it 's called shengtao narrow-leaved to go about it ?
er , you will see is also the lion 's can see this ,
er , leo . like this .
but it 's very big .
oh , it 's just over there , singapore lion as many of the words ?
a total of five .

uh-huh .
it 's probably ,
er , s $ one night is probably one hundred and fifty dollars .
two star hotel ?
yea .
now you see a group photo ?
see it .
ah , yes .
it 's just a little bit in it .
and there is one was outside , it 's just this one .
ah .
it 's in chinatown .
it 's place is pretty good .
it 's not very expensive .
are there any near the subway station ?
yes .
the subway is near .
it 's called chinatown subway station .
this , you can use the internet to check it out .
that is hotel eighty one .
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
ah , if there 's any over there .
it 's a trip .
tour .
to live there .
just have a tour group ?
just go with the group .
from the other side do you start leaves ?
or are you looking for a travel agency until after this side ?
yea .
it was just me from here in the past ,
find tour group .
okay .
okay .
then you have to go to your travel agent .
the travel agency on your side , it will help you arrange it .
ah .
that is the itinerary will probably be a little more pressing .
if i come , you can say that .
the flowering your own interest .
i still have that your time .
you can see it slowly .
ah .
it has its advantages .
exactly .
you do n't need to trouble exactly .
help you arrange it all .
the car to pick them up , and there is a guide and so on and so forth .
arrange for you all that .
the only thing is that time , do n't you can control .
generally speaking , that is .
read these words , about the same as the itinerary for a few days ?
probably four days .
usually use the last day of the time to go shopping .
ah .
uh-huh . right .
four days .
then you may be in one day .
shengtao narrow-leaved shopping now .
because you need another day .
let 's just look at other scenic spots .
ah .
or ,
go .
our .
i have told you , we have two zoo ?
yes .
yes .
you can get the zoo or night safari .
can i get birds park .
then it 's better if you have any kind of travel plans ?
that includes shopping .
usually guests are taking advantage of the last day or so that time to go shopping .
right , for example , the first day to go anywhere for fun ?
then the next day or to the park .
uh , plants care .
you said it was your own now ?
just two people .
it 's trip .
yes .
yea .
you do n't have the tour group from the right ?
right , not yet at the moment .
that
yea .
then you have to arrange your , uh , the itinerary .
for example , if you arrive at noon . we singapore .
then you can start your itinerary .
or you get there at night , i can only go and see the clarke quay .
this can be arranged by himself .
do you have a word about .
at least two days , about two and half days .
that , more or less .
because the area of singapore is n't say it is very large .
then you have to put that the main look at it , it will be fine .
some people do n't like to go to the zoo , so it wo n't necessarily have to go to the zoo .
you can only go there on time .
because it over there in the north . the one in singapore .
it 's a little bit too far away from that , relatively far from the downtown area at all .
is there anything else you want to know about that ?
uh-huh .
that is to say , how about the standard of consumption over there ?
chrge the standard .
yes .
for instance ?
it has , high-end .
there are also common .
there is
for example , on it ?
that 's the subway .
and by bus ?
pass the time about how much will it be ?
uh-huh .
uh-huh .
then , for example , for example .
you arrived .
peddler centres to eat a meal .
one meal .
only one person 's consumption .
probably s $ 4 yuan .
four dollars for it .
uh-huh .
ah .
this is peddler centres .
then , for example , do you want a little more spenders .
in the hotel ?
some of the hotel restaurant .
that 's .
another matter anymore .
but , in general , that is , in peddler centres
everyone can just eat a meal , fourty nz .
if it 's over .
four nz .
it 's not much , right ?
there are n't many four nz for us here .
uh-huh .
ah .
you over there it into the sixth .
for six .
uh-huh .
twenty-four dollars , like that .
yea .
this side is generally on this .
security is also very good .
er , evening .
on a night there wo n't be any problem , right ?
it 's ok .
it does n't cause problems .
and even , oh .
for instance , it seems we women after we get off work .
go home is also very safe .
for instance
uh-huh .
for example , go to a bar in the evening , ktv or something like that ?
uh-huh .
that 's .
no problem .
still very safe .
exactly .
do n't just telling to cause trouble .
can all
yes , % uh .
for example , personal simply [ to go ] to go and have fun .
there is no problem .
% er , there 's no better bar ?
it 's said that it was quite lively a little .
there 's % .
it 's just gave you see that clarke quay % .
that is over there .
% uh-huh .
that is ,
% uh .
all rallying over there ?
yes , all rallying .
so it was very active at night .
there 's a bar very much .
[ ] that if i want from that .
the airport directly to that clarke quay .
what would you like to sit down to how to travel ?
that houston-bound mrt line ?
% uh-huh .
i 'll show you % oh .
you 'll see later .
you just have to go directly from the airport ?
% uh-huh .
right % .
the design of the subway to see us now ?
% um see it .
yes .
do you have ?
then you % here right ?
airport .
then , green line .
that directly over here .
change here .
here is the change .
% er .
[ ] right right .
then , how [ ] how to differentiate it that the subway % ?
what divisions ?
{ noise } you follow that color % .
% .
right % .
otherwise wait a minute
% oh [ it ] it .
there is only one , right ?
you , this is the airport .
{ glug-glug audibly } airport green .
come over from here then .
it seems i just told you that % oh .
it came here , the city hall .
this is a interchange .
then you just have to take a red line on this side .
you just change the purple again .
here is not clarke quay now .
right ? so , ah .
the place .
yea .
then you just , for example , if you stay in chinatown . you are in the room next door .

probably s $ 25 dollars .
taxi .
that is
it is a headstart price over there ?
there are % , there is .
three dollars , and some are three dollars and twenty-five cents .
but it seems to be from the airport to pay more for five dollars .
five dollars .
% er , why ?
because the time to get to the airport , waiting for the guests .
because they are lining up % .
% that they may sometimes in two hours .
and then there is an extra charge % . well , it 's s $ 5 dollars .
% uh-huh .
% uh .
% uh .
you can continue to ask other problems .

uh-huh .
that is to say , okay you .
for example , your itinerary is four days .
the charge for this flight we wo n't be in oh .
uh-huh .
okay .
probably , the consumption of one person ,
if you have any er , probably s $ 1,000 yuan .
it 's just about six thousand yuan rmb .
it should be okay .
enough .
if you do n't go to those places high-end er for food ,

for example , you have to eat a meal .
oh , in a lot of on this side of the peddler centres .
peddler centres .

er , it 's just you probably 24 yuan rmb .
it 's already .
of course , if you want to go to that some relatively high-end that some restaurant in the hotel .

but generally , exactly .
we just ordinary people in singapore .

that will probably go to peddler center for lunch time
fourty dollars can be resolved .
