hello good afternoon % uh this % uh philip
% uh with % uh the % uh participant id number fifty two .
hello ?
hi philip my name is matthew , i 'm the tour guide three
how can i help you today ?
% eh % uh good afternoon .
% uh i was % uh planning a trip again to singapore % er in the next few months
and i was wondering if you could help me out % uh with the-
my % uh itinerary % uh going there ?
% uh yes certainly .
% uh firstly can i % uh find out a few things % uh from you first ,
% uh what are the things that % er you need , yah .
okay .
right .
the first thing is % um accommodation ,
do you have anything in mind for your accommodation ?
% uh right now % uh i 'm % uh on a budget
about % uh seventy to eighty % uh singapore % uh dollars pe~ per night
% uh for the accommodation .
% uh is that okay or % uh is that too low ?
% uh in fact it 's very too low .
so what usually is the rates for the % uh hotel
or % uh for the accommodation there in singapore % uh matthew ?
% um probably in a range of approximately about ninety % uh to hundred and twenty dollars .
% oh that 's very good .
and that 's inclusive already of breakfast or % uh is it only for % uh lodging ?
% uh that is not inclusive of breakfast
because usually breakfast is % uh for budgeted hotel especially that you 're looking at
asking me about eighty to ninety dollars
hundred percent you are really-
you will not get any breakfast .
okay .
for % uh-
if-
% uh probably around by a hundred dollars you might be able to get one .
% uh no not a hundred dollar sorry , hundred and twenty dollars .
% ah okay .
hundred and twenty .
and-
yah .
% ah okay .
and i 'm planning to bring % um my fianc√© there also when i visit singapore .
so % uh what 's the best % uh place near the city to stay in ?
% uh which-
what are the best place to-
i mean which hotel will be-
yah % uh that 's what i mean .
% um % uh is orchard a good place % uh to to stay when i 'm in singapore
or % uh do you have % uh other things or other places that you can recommend ?
yah .
% uh orchard road will be % uh a premium place
and accommodation wise along orchard road will be a little bit more % uh costly i will say .
okay .
so looking at % uh a little bit far away from the city area
% uh will be fairly between your budget if you are looking at it .
but the problem is you will have to take a look at the % uh transport system nearby
to the accommodation that you 're gon na put up
since you are on the budget travelers
you have to look at % uh those things % uh in mind .
okay .
okay .
yah .
alright % um first thing % um you like-
% um when you 're in singapore what are the places that you 'd like to visit ?
% uh i heard that % uh sentosa and % uh universal studios
are a good place to visit and % uh to spend the day , is that correct ?
% uh yes indeed .
% ah okay .
so for % uh sentosa
% uh how much is the budget for that % uh
for the entrance or % uh for the fee ?
alright .
% um in fact % uh let 's go one step at a time .
firstly % uh we settle your accommodation first , right ?
okay .
okay .
% uh for accommodation wise right now at the very moment looking at the budget we have
we try to locate one hotel which is fairly % uh at that kind of cheaper rate , huh .
alright so we look one for-
we look up for one hotel first , right .
okay .
% uh you are having screen sharing with me % uh right now , right ?
yup .
% uh i can see it .
you can see huh , okay .
okay , let me see what % uh-
hotel eighty one is also % uh famous in singapore % uh matthew , right ?
yes .
it 's actually a chain of hotel .
% uh they have a chain of hotel in singapore all over the places .
% uh in fact % uh many of these % uh hotels chains
they are very good at making budget hotel for people like-
% uh yah .
% uh huh .
the budget hotels % uh that 's good , yah .
yah , people like you who can travel around .
okay .
but % uh their rooms % uh is that % uh is it big or % uh-
yah i 'm going to give you % uh a out view of this hotel
so that you can have an idea % uh what are the things you expect % uh .
okay .
% uh okay , that 's good .
okay , % uh % hm .
yah , this is .
okay so how long have you been a tour guide % uh matthew ?
% um i have been a tour guide for whole past six years .
% oh that 's lot .
and-
okay , now let 's see
% uh you are planning to travel in the month of % uh-
around % uh september % uh for my birthday .
september .
yah .
september .
okay .
september for the-
yah birth~
birthday .
okay let see the ra~
rates for the hotel .
% ah , now i know why .
i guess september is a little bit more costly .
% ah okay .
so it's-
% uh the reason why because is because during that particular month
% uh there is a formula one race team will be coming here for the race
so hotel -
% ah okay .
% ah okay , yah .
tha~ that 's where the last week of september right
for the % uh f one race ?
% uh right .
so the hotel room will be a little bit more % uh co~
if we can make it % uh august ,
% uh let 's check august or october .
august or october % ah ?
% uh yah .
and i have n't book % uh a flight yet
so % uh we could check those months as well .
% uh yah .
okay , let 's see .
let me just get to-
i 'm trying to get the hotel near to the transport system
so that you % uh will definitely be able to fully enjoy your holiday .
okay .
% um yah .
yah .
okay .
i hope there 's % uh a cheap rate % uh for the month of august .
yah , now you can see for your screen right now
% uh it 's a lot more cheaper , right ?
okay .
yah compare to a while ago hundred seventy nine , hundred eighty yah .
now you get what i 'm trying to put across .
yah .
right .
% uh for this hotel % uh at the present moment is not inclusive of breakfast , okay .
but the hotel vicinity you should be able to get % uh what you call
breakfast easily , no problem .
okay .
okay .
okay within the vicinity .
yah .
% um these are the-
some of the screenshots of the % uh hotel premises
you can see how the room look like .
the exterior of the hotel and the guest room , the bathroom and the balcony .
okay .
actually it 's big % uh since it has a balcony in a terrace .
yah , some of them they are having balconies .
so either move a little bit downward and there you see , yah .
so reception of the hotel , interior , the entrance and the bathroom .
yah .
okay .
okay .
okay i see .
and these are the facility here they have inside the hotel .
% uh as you can see there is wifi which is there , complimentary wifi
so you need not have to pay for the wifi .
i ca n't see .
okay .
yah .
% uh laundry services usually is % uh chargeable , yah .
twenty fourth , % hm .
% uh i do n't think we will be do % uh laundering in % uh when we stay there
or we-
there 's a need for it
but % uh nevertheless it 's good .
at least % uh they included it .
% uh yah .
it 's not included but you have to pay for that .
% uh you can avail of it .
okay , i understand now .
alright .
alright .
% uh right .
so the next thing is you want to know how to get to your hotel .
am i right to say that ?
because if you know there 's a hotel like that 's % uh there but how to get towards that place
that will be also another big problem for you .
okay .
okay .
right .
now % um looking at the hotel is actually located somewhere in the city area
% uh that 's where you can % uh do your shopping if you want to
it 's also nearby to orchard road if you want to go .
so % uh you can see the blue coloured dot which is there
a big circle with a bit narrow
that in fact is the hotel
that hotel eighty one bugis , alright .
okay .
okay let me just check
% uh screen is % uh loading .
okay , so the blue one yah .
yah .
yah the blue one , right .
so % uh-
okay .
% uh matthew for this street
% uh what street % uh is hotel eighty one in ?
is it the bugis street or what specific street % uh-
yah .
it 's actually along middle road .
middle road , okay .
yah middle road .
and middle road is located in the city area itself .
and of course you are very quite accessible to three % uh train system here in singapore .
% uh one is the ew twelve .
if you look onto your map that is actually % uh bugis station .
% uh ew stands for east west bound train station twelve .
okay .
okay .
okay .
% uh this this is for the % uh mrt transport , is this correct ?
correct .
% ah okay .
now do you also like to know how to get from the airport to your hotel , right ?
because % uh budget travellers you definitely want to save % uh some money for yourself .
yah .
% uh i~
for the % uh budget terminal
is this the % uh changi airport ?
yes but it 's not budget terminal but i want to say is you are travelling on a budget
so you definitely need
% uh you need % uh a public transport to go around , right ?
okay .
right .
so if you will just take a quick look at the ew eighteen
you just take note about this
% uh ew eighteen is with bugis % uh station , okay ?
now i 'm going to go to another screen
that has the train system from changi airport to your hotel , okay .
okay .
% um okay .
alright .
so can you see the whole map of the transport system ?
% uh it's-
yah right now .
yah it 's fully loaded already .
okay .
now if you were to look on to your right hand side
you 'll find that the changi airport is on the right hand side just on three-
% ah okay , number three right ?
yes .
now the changi airport has a train system , the mrt station
which will lead you all the way toward your hotel whereby it 's near to bugis .
can you see bugis on the green colour track going all the way to bugis ?
green .
% ah okay .
so it 's only a one ride from the airport
if you 're going to the % uh-
if you 're going to take the mrt .
correct .
it is not actually one ride but it 's actually two rides which are there .
% ah okay .
% ah , okay .
first ride which is from changi airport you will end up in tanah merah ,
you can see a green coloured dot which is here .
now you have to switch platform in order to get the train towards bugis .
on tanah merah , yah .
yah the white one .
from tanah merah to bugis , okay .
alright .
and if you see there is % uh two white coloured dot which is here
and that is to tell you that there is an interchange in between
if you want to get connected onto a different rail .
% ah okay .
for the yellow % uh rail ?
for the yellow that we called it the circle line .
circle line stands for cc , yah .
% ah okay .
okay .
okay .
so you are not going to use that
because you 're gon na go all the way green until bugis .
so from the airport towards bugis
that will takes you about forty to forty five minutes of train ride , alright ?
okay .
and for singa~
% uh for getting into the train is very simple
almost like the similar one % uh in your place
but % uh the thing is in singapore , here in what you need to do is
you need to know the station you 're going to get down .
so when you go to the ticket counter you can % um get the ticket for the bugis
% uh and you 'll get your refund % uh of the ticket at the ticketing counter .
so % uh the estimated fare will be around about two dollars sixty cents
and with the deposit it will cost you three dollar and sixty , alright ?
okay , sure .
okay .
% uh yah .
% uh i just want to know also
for example i 'll be using the train for my whole stay
is there a prepaid card or a card that we could load
so % uh i would n't be % uh queuing anymore on the ticket counters ?
yes there is a tourist pass
but % uh if i 'm not wrong it 's a fifteen dollars % uh three days pass
or it could have take arrive on between , yah .
% ah okay .
okay .
so that 's good .
well of course depends on you whether you really need so much or not
because you hardly use % uh so much of the train can walk % uh yah
because you 're only on two days with % uh-
hardly spend so much , yah .
okay .
two days , yah .
yah .
and also matthew % uh what 's the % uh operation hours of the train
or what does-
% uh what time does it start and what 's the % uh last trip for it ?
right .
the train system starts at five thirty in the morning
the last train disconnect will be at twelve midnight .
% ah okay .
so that 's % uh-
there 's a long hours of operation .
okay that 's good .
right .
correct .
so if you will take the train down it will leaves you back-
it will leaves you to your hotel where the bugis is
yah the bugis eighty one .
okay .
right .
so at that area-
in fact you are located in the middle of the city
and from there % uh towards some of the shopping area nearby is % uh walking distance .
okay .
% uh that 's good .
right .
so you can see % uh from your hotel towards this area here called suntec city .
now suntec city is one of the largest shopping mall in singapore .
they have % uh-
there is about two hundred and seventy retail shops are there .
alright easily keep you occupying for the whole day in fact .
and next to the suntec city -
% uh i will say in the suntec city itself there is a fountain which is there .
that is the world largest water fountain
and it 's called the fountain of wealth .
so if you want to catch that attraction you can also walk across
towards these suntec city tower one , two , three and four .
these towers are being surrounded the world largest water fountain .
okay .
okay .
okay .
% hm okay .
okay .
% uh yah in % uh suntec matthew % uh are there it shops also ?
'cause i 'm plan~
% uh yes .
in suntec city we do have it shop .
the it is known as ep centre .
okay .
ep centre .
or otherwise you can also take a train down towards the funan it mall ,
that 's where you can pick up some of the latest electronic gadget .
% ah okay .
right .
that 's good .
okay so i guess we 're settled with the % uh accommodation
with hotel eighty one % uh in the in middle road .
so % uh what other things that % uh can you suggest % uh for me ?
what other % uh tourist spots that i can visit when i-
when we visit there matthew ?
right .
% uh looking at your vicinity % uh you are also located quite near to waterloo street .
the waterloo street is another % uh nice spot for tourist
% uh specially visiting the % uh waterloo street temple .
alright i 'm blowing this thing up for you
to let you have a look at the waterloo street , yah .
okay .
okay .
now if you were to look on to your right hand side
this is your hotel .
right .
and we have the national library next to us
and further up you got % uh stamford centre
and of course % uh next to the stamford centre we have the % uh kwan im temple
which is one of the oldest temple here and along the street .
and next to the temple there is also a hindu temple
which is also a very heritage % uh temple , yah .
okay .
okay .
so in fact % uh you are also able to get access into our hawker centre .
this hawker centre in fact is referring to food court .
% uh it 's non-air conditioner so we call it hawker centre .
okay .
% oh so it 's an open space
% uh it 's an open space , right ?
% uh no it 's not an open space it 's sheltered
but the thing is % um it 's non-air conditioner .
% ah okay , i get % uh-
% uh each individual stall are selling their food
but you are-
if you want you can go towards the stall and see what they are selling
and then you can order from them and pick up your food from the stall holders
and you can-
after they have make the meal they will bring it back to your % um % uh-
seats % uh to get your meal , yah .
okay .
% oh yah .
and % uh for here matthew % uh what 's the budget % uh for each meal ?
right .
you can estimate yourself if you-
you are not a vegetarian are n't you ?
% uh no .
alright good .
now if it 's not a vegetarian then why it is not an issue
because most of the food here-
% uh if you were to go to a hawker centre
estimated per meal will cost you around about six dollars .
comfortably you can have one good meal with a cup of soft drink .
okay .
yah .
i heard from a friend that % uh a good % um how do you call it ?
it 's a restaurant it 's the % uh al~ % uh although a in singapore % uh for the steam chicken .
you 're referring to our local favourite dishes , right ?
yah .
yah .
now the local favourite dishes is known as hainanese chicken rice .
hainanese chicken rice , yah .
% ah okay .
yah % uh hainanese chicken rice .
now the hainanese chicken rice in fact is also located very near % uh to your hotel
if you want to try the hainanese chicken rice .
alright let 's scroll a little bit up here .
% um you can see that your hotel is located here at bugis .
now two street across the road you can see-
can you see bugis street and seah street ?
yah the blue one , yah .
let me just check it still loading .
okay there you go .
can you see bugis street and seah street ?
yah .
now bugis street are very famous for the duck .
we have % uh what you call black sauce duck .
and seah street are very popular for it 's chicken .
okay .
okay .
yah .
so hainanese chicken rice % uh in fact once generated from that particular street .
% ah okay .
% uh so-
okay .
yah .
so you can get the traditional hainanese chicken rice from there .
and the cost of it % uh how much ?
the cost of the chicken rice if it 's your normal dishes
will probably cost you around about three fifty .
% ah okay .
so that 's cheap , yah .
yah .
so if you order another cup of drinks probably about a dollar plus
and then makes about to four dollar , five dollars per meal .
okay , that 's good .
at least % uh-
yah like what you said a while ago % uh
we wo n't be having a difficult time in getting food % uh within the vicinity .
correct .
% ah okay .
okay .
going back to our % um % uh to the placesthat % uh we can visit while we are there matthew .
alright .
now i guess you have % uh just now asked me about universal studio right ?
yah that 's the % uh-
yes everybody are very keen on universal studio .
i think they just opened last year ,
two thousand eleven or two thousand ten , matthew ?
two years back .
% ah okay .
two year-
they open two years back
and % um they have recently la~
% uh this year they add-in a few more rides which are there .
and now first thing is you want to know how to get there right ?
yah % uh from bugis .
alright .
now from bugis the direction towards that place there are a few option .
one you can take the train system towards % uh the universal studio on your own .
% uh two you can take a bus % uh towards the harbourfront okay .
now i 'm gon na just show it to you how you 're gon na move around
from your hotel to universal studio , huh ?
okay .
yah okay .
alright .
now you can see % uh on your screen
% uh right there you have public buses .
okay .
now the public buses you can pick it up from your-
near to your hotel
is bus number one hundred .
okay .
now that bus will take you all the way towards harbourfront .
harbourfront which is % uh one of the % uh place whereby you can take the sky-
to the what you call sentosa express to the % um universal studio .
okay so you have to take note that it 's bus number one hundred , okay ?
% oh to-
okay .
universal studio , okay .
okay .
is universal studio also near % um % uh sentosa ?
i 'm sorry ?
is universal studio also near sentosa ?
% uh yes universal studio in fact is located inside sentosa .
% ah okay .
yah .
so we 're hitting two birds in one stone when % uh we visit-
correct .
so if you are going to sentosa and universal studio
you can % uh pick it out from there .
okay .
so at least for the whole day % uh we can visit to % uh vicinities-
two place .
yah , two places already .
okay let me see whether i can pick up those .
% uh what other rides were added % uh this year % uh in universal studios , matthew ?
% uh one of the newest one is the transformer .
% ah okay .
yah you should n't miss that transformer .
have you % uh try the ride already ?
yes i tried the ride myself it 's very interesting
and of course that also depends on individual .
you-
are you having-
% uh you are physically fit i guess so .
yah .
% uh i like % uh trying the rides % uh in % uh any theme parks as well .
alright .
so i guess % uh that is the bus number you can take towards vivocity
to get your ride on to sentosa express to universal studio .
okay .
now the other way is you can also pick up some % um free shuttle buses .
the free shuttle buses is only available at certain location .
alright % uh the place where you are staying right now-
that you are staying will be at % uh the bugis
it 's quite near to swiss the stamford hotel .
okay .
okay .
now swiss the stamford hotel is not far away from your hotel
but you will have to take note about the timing for the free shuttle bus .
we % uh say free shuttle bus means % uh provided if you have your passport with you
to prove that you are a visitor is singapore
you can get a free ride on this shuttle bus , okay .
now swiss the stamford hotel , just take note this first
and i will show you the location of the swiss the stamford hotel % uh right now .
okay , yah .
now take a look on the map it 's coming up right now on your screen .
right , can you see your hotel ?
okay let me s~
okay .
yup
alright .
now can you see this hotel here ?
what 's the speci~
% uh the fairmont % uh okay .
swissotel the stanford , yah .
correct .
so this is the location where you can pick up the free shuttle bus .
okay .
alright .
you have to walk from your hotel all the way to this hotel here
to pick up the free rides or the free shuttle service to the universal studio .
okay .
alright .
so this is your transportation part .
now there is the second way that you can go .
obviously you like to know % um how much is gon na cost you for the ticket , for the admission ,
am i right to say that ?
yah .
yah .
absolutely .
i guess so huh .
everybody are very keen on what their budget .
budget .
yah .
okay , let me pull out the other screen for you
and i 'll show you how to get your ticket .
% um okay .
now i 'm gon na pull out a chart right now .
a chart whereby the universal studio two thousand and twelve calendar .
okay .
alright .
you can see the calendar right now on your page .
let me-
waiting for it .
% uh all i can see right now is just the map
and now it 's getting to resorts world sentosa .
not-
okay there we go .
two thousand twelve calendar , yah .
yah .
correct .
now the two thousand and twelve calendar is the calendar
which shows you about the % uh ticket price to universal studio .
since you are travelling in the month of august
you 'll find that a lot of them are in orange in colour
that means that is non-peak .
but the one which is green in colour that is peak
because it 's during the weekend .
so of course weekend rate will be a lot more costly compare to the non-weekend yah .
now if you 're going during the non-peak
you 'll find that the adult ticket is actually sixty eight dollars .
okay .
okay that 's good .
% oh weekends .
yah .
okay .
on the left
yah sixty eight dollars .
sixty eight fifty for child and senior
thirty .
yah .
alright .
then of course if you have two person is going
then you have the one twenty , one thirty six , yah .
and of course you can see that there is an express pass at thirty dollars .
okay .
yah , what does that mean ?
% uh what is that for ?
now the express pass actually pays on top of your % uh normal admission .
the express pass actually helps you to ease the long waiting queue time
on any of the rides or attractions or movies , alright .
yah .
okay .
so for ex~
okay , % uh if i get this correct so i 'll be-
% uh for non-peak that 's sixty eight
then if i just wanted % uh to ride everything without % uh queuing up
i just need to to add % uh thirty dollars is that correct ?
% uh yes , i will not say no queuing up
but on a shorter queue .
% ah okay .
on a shorter queue yah .
so you pay thirty dollars just to get away from getting % uh queuing up .
along .
yah along and wasting your time in the % uh queuing up for the rides , yah .
okay .
right .
so this is how the price are being range , okay .
it 's alright .
yah .
and % uh if i may ask matthew ,
% um for april let me % uh let me
% oh can we go back to the % uh calendar ?
yah i 'm at the calendar .
okay , right .
i think it 's still loading , okay .
for the month of june and july % uh it 's almost at the peak season
% uh why is this ?
now because % uh starting from may the twenty sixth onward
it 's actually a school holiday .
% ah okay .
% uh that 's ma~
it 's a school holiday in singapore .
the children-
the school children has one month of this school holiday .
they made as year school holidays .
so it 's like the % uh summer vacation ?
correct .
so that is the reason why this is a full green and a full rate .
% ah okay .
okay .
okay now i know .
now and the full rate has carry another meaning for it .
the full rate means that is super peak
and you probably might not be able to get a ticket
if you do not go one month in advance .
% uh ahead of time , okay .
yah .
so that is the meaning of this super peak .
and there is also % um a crowds management or crowds capacities are limited inside the universal studio .
especially during the peak and the super peak
% uh they only allow about eight thousand visitors inside the universal studio .
the-
super peak , yah .
% um okay .
so i guess the super peak dates are % uh singapore holidays ?
% uh yes , in fact right .
okay .
so if you want to get in around that time
then probably you have to pay a lot more
like the super peak is seventy four you have to add another fifty
you get about hundred and twenty four .
% um yah .
% oh that 's costly already , yah .
% uh yah .
a little bit costly would be on the budget huh .
okay .
alright .
now coming back i think you would like to know
% uh what is there to offer you inside universal studio .
okay .
now this is another screen which is gon na come up into your computer
and this in fact is the whole area of the universal studio .
the whole universal studio is of-
is been designed in this manner .
% uh yes .
so i saw there that 's % uh explore the seven zones , right ?
yah exploring the seven zones , yah .
and this seven zones compresses of rides , movies % uh actions , alright
% uh and also restaurant as well .
so depends on you .
% ah okay .
action .
yah .
i think i saw one interesting the sci-fi city .
sci-fi city .
okay we go to sci-fi city .
yah .
% uh that 's a roller coaster ride , right ?
now-
yes indeed it is a roller coaster ride .
you can see the % uh blue and you can also see the red .
the red o~
yah .
now both of the stripes is known as battlestar galactica .
% ah okay battlestar , okay .
yah battlestar galactica .
you-
have you watch the movie battlestar galactica ?
yah i have .
okay .
now just before the pilot got into the aircraft what did they do ?
okay .
what did they do ?
which is-
for the-
% uh i think there was a % uh-
before they got onto the aircraft
they were supposed to sit onto % uh a .
yah .
the~
there was a chase scene right there .
yah a chasing ride , right ?
yah .
so that chasing ride has actually put onto this sci-fi centre
which we call the battlestar galactica
cylon-
human versus cylon .
we call it human versus cylon is because
both of this roller coaster will start simultaneously at the same time .
so they are actually challenging their speed with one another
crisscross-
% uh cutting across one another and you-
the whole duration is only about one minute of the ride .
okay .
okay .
okay , that 's fast .
but i think-
% uh that 's fast .
the speed of the roller coaster is at eighty two point eight kilometres per hour .
% wow that 's really fast .
i-
% uh that 's it .
if you are seating in car you do n't feel anything
but if you are flying outside then you definitely feel a lot of impact .
okay yah .
i mean it 's open air and-
then-
then we have the transformer here .
% uh we-
you have-
you seen the movie called transformer , right ?
alright .
this transformer is very new in universal studio
and it actually give you a feeling that you are in the automist % uh fighting battles
against the % um % uh the bad guys huh .
% oh decepticons , yah .
so if-
yah decepticons , yah .
so-
so it 's a three d % uh type of ride ?
it 's a three d in fact yes .
you are supposed to wear the glasses and of course % uh the rides will take you up and down
fronting , turning , swinging , it 's very interesting .
that is one of the best i will say so far .
% ah okay .
how many % uh minutes does the % uh the ride usually last
or the duration of it ?
% uh usually it takes about five minutes and above .
% oh that 's long .
a long but good and fun .
yah .
right .
% uh so this is % um-
okay .
human
right .
okay .
% uh with-
% uh inside the universal studio are they strict in smoking also ?
% uh smoking is prohibited at most of the sheltered area .
okay .
but % uh do we have designated areas for smoking inside universal ?
so-
% uh no we do n't have any smoking area inside universal studio .
% uh you can't-
if it 's too tempting you can not % uh smoke .
% uh okay .
% uh okay .
then you should stay in singapore you 'll be quit % uh smoking .
yah that 's what i heard .
okay .
now % uh this is universal studio .
so % uh if you have done this universal studio and you have some more time
% uh another place that you-
that i would like to recommend you is to go to sentosa .
okay .
now inside this sentosa is % um only % uh a train ride
of % uh two station away from % uh the universal studio , alright .
% uh okay .
okay .
now % uh one of the % uh most exciting area that i will like you to go
is to visit the song of the sea in the evening
because the minute
once you are done with universal studio % uh you would should be around about six to seven p.m . right ?
and since you have the time you should % uh make your way to sentosa
and visit this song of the sea % uh which is-
the show is happening at seven forty and eight forty daily , alright .
e~ % uh .
okay .
how to get there is to take the sentosa express from the universal studio
two stops away and it will lead you to beach station .
and at beach station you can pick up the ticket at the ticketing counter .
universal studio .
okay .
% ah okay .
so i~
it 's only ten dollars per person
you can pick it up from there .
okay .
right .
so that will cover your full day in % uh sentosa .
and-
okay .
right .
then % uh the other thing is % uh on the second day itself if you have time
probably you like to do the % uh shopping % uh the-
yah what % uh establishment or % uh-
what if-
yah .
or you can also you know take a walk down % uh to our historical sites
where % uh the esplanade park is .
you can see the esplanade park % uh-
yah i saw in the map that it 's near % uh the hotel .
yes it 's near to the hotel so walking distance
and you can also see the esplanade theatre on the bay .
% um if i reduce the size a little bit
and you probably will be able to see that you are also quite near to the merlion park .
yah please .
also be-
okay .
i heard that % uh marina bay is also a good place % uh to check out
% uh because % uh i heard from a friend that % uh it 's near the % um race track of the f one .
right .
ye~ % uh yes marina bay is-
marina bay sands is quite near to the racing track of the formula one
it 's not in front of the racing track .
okay i remember .
yah .
so if you want to see marina bay sand
then i 'm viewing you this .
yah .
right .
% uh it 's coming up onto your screen right now .
yah .
and this is marina bay sand .
now marina bay sand is also not very far away from your hotel .
so let me just show it to you where is the marina bay sand .
now if you see from your hotel towards the marina bay sand is not far away
the blue one towards this one here , okay .
% ah okay , that 's good .
and if you want to go to marina bay sand
you can also take the circle line which is quite near to your hotel .
yah .
yah marina bay .
you can see cc three here .
you take this cc three here it will lead you to cc four
then there is another entra~
there is another train system near to marina bay sand here .

yah .
so it 's quite nearby % um to the train system you can see .
i just let you have a look again huh
you can see cc four , right ?
can you see cc four ?
yah % uh ya~
cc four promenade .
okay .
now i 'm going to go to the other screen % uh where the train system is .
just now when you see cc four promenade ?
yah .
this is promenade on your screen .
that means-
% ah okay .
and from promenade to bayfront which is the marina bay sand
this is the stop
so one stop away .
okay .
okay .
okay .
so it 's quite nearby , accessible by train near to your hotel .
okay .
alright .
so i got to blow these thing a little bit up .
okay .
and % uh how is the traffic in % uh singapore % uh matthew ?
how is the traffic ?
yah % uh do we % uh-
for example if rush hour so what time we % uh-
okay .
the peak hour is usually starts from % uh morning at around about seven thirty
and then around about nine thirty a.m .
then the second peak hour will start at % uh five in the evening
it will end at around about nine thirty .
% ah okay .
so-

i 'm participant number fifty three .
hi carla .
my % uh-
i am tour guide number three .
okay .
how can i help you today ?
% uh alright .
wait a minute tour guide number three .
% um i just wan na check out % um some things that i can do ,
'cause i 'm planning to go to % um singapore
maybe first week of april ,
because it 's a holiday in the philippines during that time .
so % um aside from the activities .
well % um let me just tell you by the way that i only have % um a thousand singapore dollars for this trip .
so-
okay .
% oh sorry , i did n't catch your name .
so you ha~
my name is mathew .
okay .
hey mathew , how is it going ?
so % um % uh , yah .
again i need to go to singapore
first week of april .
% uh my cash is only a thousand singapore dollars
and i need to know % um maybe top five things that i should do
in singapore .
it has to be really enjoyable , okay ?
okay .
now % uh before i actually % uh plan the thing for you , a few things that i need to ask % uh from you .
that is number one , % uh in singapore itself
what are the things that you like to see most ?
you like to do a little bit more shopping ,
you prefer to go to theme park ,
or you prefer to % uh see more nature ?
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
% oh okay .
because in singapore itself , it 's very famous for its garden in the city .
in fact the gar~
we call it a garden in the city .
garden .
% uh huh .
and or you can also call it city in the garden .
so % um in fact % uh nature is one of the % uh best thing that we try to put up % uh in our-
the whole island of singapore , yah .
so that depends on you where you-
what aim-
% uh makes you interest more .
what you like to see more in singapore ?
so i can plan it accordingly .
okay .
alright .
so % um for you to plan accordingly , i think i also got ta tell you that
i 've been to singapore maybe two years ago .
and % um-
alright .
yah , the trip was nice .
% uh but the places i mostly went to were theme parks ,
like of course we have the universal studio
and % um i went to-
% um i do n't know .
there 's this one place that is similar to ocean park ,
it 's in sentosa .
what do you call that place ?
okay. ,
% uh the sentosa , right ?
% uh yah .
% uh i went there and i went to this some sort of big aquarium .
i forgot what to call it .
yah .
% uh underwater world .
% oh the , yah .
been there and i went to jurong park .
okay .
and i , yah .
and , yah , i also-
i already mentioned % um universal studios .
but this time around % um mathew ,
i wan na check out what single ladies could do in singapore % um in april ,
'cause i 'm going there with my friends , two of my lady friends .
% um so i do n't think that they would enjoy nature parks .
so for the thing that i wan na do ,
i do wan na check out the nightlife .
yah .
% oh the nightlife ?
yah .
okay .
i wan na check out the nightlife .
and % uh i wan na try out some good food .
but the thing about good food is that ,
% um please do not % um refer to me a restaurant that serves fatty foods ,
because i 've just had this operation .
so get rid of those restaurants okay ?
yah , and i 'm on the budget mathew .
i only have like a thousand singapore dollars .
okay .
alright .
% huh , so based on the information i gathered from you ,
% uh i guess you ne~
you wo n't be going back to sentosa ,
you will not be going back to universal studio ,
you will not be going to jurong bird park , right ?
yah .
% uh huh .
yes .
okay , now % uh there is a hotel which is quite % uh nearby to what i think you might like ,
but of course i would like to highlight to you
that this hotel is located somewhere near to little india .
okay , why ?
okay .
why huh ?
is it because it 's cheap ?
% uh not only that .
but the hotels looks slightly better compare to % uh the rest of the hotel
especially two ladies
% uh you are travelling on your own or you 're travelling with somebody else ?
% oh i 'm travelling with two other ladies
who are single i might add .
yes .
% oh two other ladies .
i think that 's okay .
so i guess % uh this hotel here called hotel fragrance at selegie
will be a nice place % uh to put up ,
alright ?
% uh huh .
% oh okay .
yah .
now let me just % uh show you the hotel first , huh ?
right .
% oh no .
% oh why % oh no ?
you see-
% ah okay , there you are .
coming back .
so you are coming-
% uh you are visiting singapore in a month of when ?
i-
% uh yes .
which month was that ?
% oh i 'm sorry ?
which month you do plan to come to singapore ?
which manner ?
which month ?
which month ?
% oh which month ?
i 'm sorry .
yah .
yes .
% um first week april ,
probably april % um-
% oh that 's gon na be next week , right ?
april five , six and seven .
five , si~-
you only have five and six , right ?
you pi~
five , yah .
% oh yes , two days .
okay , two days .
and let us check out the rates on the fifth first , yah ?
okay .
right .
you need-
so here we are .
we have the hotel rooms rate at one zero five .
alright .
and there 's only three rooms left now .
three rooms left ?
yup .
% oh okay .
right .
now this hotel % uh the facility wise ,
as you can see while i 'm scrolling down .
% uh huh .
you can see the exterior of the hotel ,
it looks very pleasant .
yes .
the reception is good .
there is also a swimming pool out there paying such a one zero five per room per night .
if you have a swimming pool , you should be very happy ,
because % um none of the hotel at this kind of rate
will give you a swimming pool .
% uh huh .
% oh okay .
but it 's kinda tight though for the swimming pool .
% uh what the capacity of % uh the swimming pool part ?
alright .
okay % um probably around about a hundred % uh swimmers maybe .
just looking as to the pool .
at the same time ?
a hundred swimmers at the same time , huh ?
soak in the-
okay well then .
soak in the pool i never say can swim around , huh .
% oh okay .
right .
as you can see the facilities % uh for the hotel % uh
% uh there 's a coffee shops which are there .
% uh of course the coffee shops of course % er your hotel rooms are not inclusive of the breakfast .
% uh huh .
so breakfast , you can either pick it up from the hotel on a separate basis .
or you can also try our local breakfast
which is available % uh next to the hotel ,
we call it coffee shop .
usually % uh to have the breakfast at the coffee shop is a lot more cheaper
compared to having a breakfast in the hotel .
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
at the hotel ?
yes .
% oh yah , cool .
so % um is the coffee shop some of sort of a restaurant or is it like a kiosk ?
% uh the coffee shop refers in the hotel is actually something like a small restaurant .
% uh if you wan na take a look , i will pull it this thing up .
you can see % uh down-
up on your screen % uh there is the restaurant which is there .
that is what we call the normal coffee shop in the hotel .
but % uh coffee shops outside the hotel is a bit different .
% uh let me just pull out % uh some scene of the coffee shop in singapore
and let you have an idea
of what the coffee shops we are talking about , yah .
% oh okay .
yes .
% uh huh .
% oh okay , wait .
% um hold up mathew .
yah .
i got ta know how much is it 's one hundred five for two days stay in this hotel ?
% oh is it , yah .
hundred and five for-
per day it 's not for-
% ah okay .
am i gon na get the superior room with one big bed or the twin room ?
okay , now for-
% uh for one zero five .
for one zero five , your room is like for two person .
that means that for tw~
yah .
yah .
for two pip .
% uh % oh so i need to kick out one of my friends , % huh ?
so that 's why .
so you have to add one more room
you do n't kick out him .
or maybe there 's another way .
you can make him-
you can make the additional person sleep on the floor .
okay .
so % uh i'm-
% oh they 're gon na allow that ?
no i did n't say that you assumed .
okay .
we 're just gon na probably toss coin , right ?
or % um , yah .
okay or we can take turns .
yah .
but % um i need to make sure % um mathew
if they 're gon na allow three ladies occupy one room .
% uh i re~-
i guess this you better check it out with the hotel itself .
because there 's a re-
you can see from here on your screen
that the bed type can be either one queen sized bed
or two single bedded .
subject to request availability of the hotel .
say if you ask for a queen sized bed ,
probably three person can squeeze in .
% ah okay .
% uh huh .
yes .
% uh huh .
but % uh-
okay .
% uh that-
or i can get in a fight with her today ,
so that i wo n't have to bring her along with us right ?
yah , okay .
i think we could do the negotiations once we get there .
yah , or the other one can get % uh one more additional room .
% uh huh .
% oh i 'm travelling on a really tight budget .
but % um then you take turn to sleep on a bigger bed .
okay , is this the cheapest % um i could get ?
% uh yes , i would say because ,
you can see that % uh you were not be able to get such a good hotel rate .
i can show you some other hotel as well ,
but you will find that the hotel is a lot more % um expensive compare to this one , yah .
how does it-
yes .
% oh okay .
so a cheaper hotel than this would n't look really presentable , right ?
either-
% hm yup .
probably just fan ,
not air-conditioned in singapore .
% oh no .
% oh no .
okay , let me see what i can get .
i pull out another hotel which is % um near to that particular area
and you can see % uh from here the rate ,
how much it 's gon na be .
yah .
where is this at ?
it 's near where ?
huh ?
it 's right-
% oh it 's in bugis .
yah .
it 's where the cheapest stuff are , right ?
% uh yes .
i 'm putting you up near to the area .
'cause i 'm a really cheap lady , you see .
% uh not cheap lady , but you 're smarter in controlling your budget , yah .
yes .
here you see ?
you can see down here
how much is gon na be .
% oh hundred and twenty seven .
okay .
yah , compare to the one that is there .
how much is gon na cost you ?
% uh that 's just one zero five ,
and i just simply have to kick out one of my friends , right ?
% uh same thing % uh to that particular hotel ,
you still have to kick him out .
% uh yes .
okay that 's a hundred five .
okay , before we go to the coffee shop ,
i 'm concerned about % um the transportation .
% um as to how-
what-
how cheap is the transpo ?
is it accessible ?
i mean is it near the bus stops ?
right .
the fragrance hotel .
okay , now-
so we first go for the fragrance hotel , yah ?
yes .
now-
i do n't think we can go to the other one ,
'cause it 's % um a lot more expensive , right ?
okay , so we go for this one .
by now i 'm gon na show you where is it located ,
so that you have an idea what i 'm gon na talk to you about , alright ?
okay .
right .
okay .
alright .
right .
so if you see on your map right now
you will find that the hotel which you are gon na put up
will be fragrance hotel at selegie .
% uh huh .
and this is not far away from bugis .
% oh okay .
okay ?
alright .
and you can see there are two trains % uh network % uh located nearby
to the hotel .
one of the train is called the little india
which is a northeast train .
% uh huh .
okay .
station number seven .
% oh alright .
you can see the magenta in colour , right ?
that is the northeast line .
and the other line is actually the ew twelve
which is % uh located at bugis .
bugis .
alright .
okay .
so you have been to bugis , right ?
yes , been there .
okay , now good .
so and since you are a budget travellers ,
you probably would like to do a little bit of using our local transport system
to travel to the places you want to go , right ?
% uh which is cheaper , train or bus ?
well buses will take a little bit longer time .
but train system will be a lot more comfortable because
you get to enjoy the view , good view
% uh while you are taking the train ride , yah .
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
% oh yes .
right .
but where do i get to-
where can i get those cards ?
% ah do n't worry ,
i 'm going to go step-by-step for you .
wow ! okay cool .
wow ! okay cool .
now , you can see that the hotel is here
and the train system ew twelve .
i want you to take a look carefully at ew twelve .
okay .
but ew twelve is actually bugis , right ?
% uh huh .
it 's the bugis station .
now , i 'm gon na go to another screen
where the train network system is , alright ?
% uh huh .
yes .
alright .
can you see the train system network now ?
% uh not yet , it 's still loading i guess .
still nothing .
okay , there you go .
yah .
now you can see % uh the whole train network system here .
% uh huh .
from changi airport , that 's where the international airport is .
% uh huh .
where you gon na land % uh when you are coming .
yes .
so from there , the changi airport ,
you will have to take the train which is the east-west train .
so that 's why we call it ew % uh .
ew .
% oh that 's why , okay .
it 's the green line , right ?
so you-
yah .
yes , it 's the green line you remember ?
% oh yes .
i asked you to take a look at bugis .
% uh huh .
okay , you locate the bugis
along that green track .
% uh huh .
right .
now if you 'll gon na take the train system from changi airport ,
you probably will have to end-up at this station called tanah merah
which is two stops away from the changi airport .
% uh huh .
yes .
now , you have to go across the platform to % uh switch the train
towards all the way to bugis .
okay .
when you end-up in bugis ,
% uh the fare will be approximately about two dollars and sixty cents .
per person .
on top of that , you 'll probably will have to pay additional of one dollar extra
for the deposit of the ticket .
the minute when you reach your destination , you can get your refund on the deposit of the ticket
by putting the ticket into the machine .
it will get to the refund .
% uh huh .
okay .
alright .
alright .
right .
so you will end up at bugis .
so right now i 'm gon na go back to bugis , alright .
so on your map again you can see ew twelve which is the bugis station .
% oh just a minute
it 's not yet loading .
okay there .
yah .
so from the bugis station towards your hotel ,
it 's gon na be about fifteen-
ten to fifteen minutes ' walk .
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
but if you do n't want to , you wish to take a bus ,
you can always take out the bus which is
% uh on the map you can see some small little blue dot which are there .
% ah yah .
those are bus stops .
you can take up any of the buses along the way
which is heading toward bukit timah .
so bukit timah from rochor road all the way to bukit timah
this will be the stop you 're gon na get down and walk towards your hotel nearby .
% oh okay , yes .
quite nearby , yah .
yes .
so this is one way you can get to your hotel and also % uh the easiest way to move around .
right .
so getting to your hotel , not a problem .
okay .
so going to little india will not be a problem for you as well because
your hotel is located near to little india .
you can see that the serangoon road is here .
this serangoon road is the whole area here is known as little india .
the street which has a lot-
% uh selling a lot of indian ornament and accessories .
% uh huh .
i think your ladies friends will like % uh to shop along the street as well .
% uh now this street is very popular for it 's % uh the indian % uh what you call % uh
decoration item .
you can % uh also pick it up from there , yah .
% oh okay .
% um but % um which goods are cheaper at ?
% uh little india or bugis ?
so-
that depends on what you want .
in little india mainly cater for the indian taste .
okay .
right and bugis is asia .
so if you have to move towards bugis ,
you 'll find that % uh a lot of things you can pick it up at bugis junction ,
at bugis village .
% uh huh .
okay .
right .
so we have the
% oh so the chocolates are found in little india
at little india i mean , right ?
chocolates .
really cheap chocolates .
yah .
sorry ?
chocolates ?
well the-
along the way towards % uh the bugis ,
% uh you can see there 's % uh road name call middle road .
okay , you see my mouse here ?
yes .
yah there is middle road which is there .
% uh huh .
now this middle road % uh there is a building called gsm building .
gsm , you know the cell phone gsm ?
% oh yah .
yah , they-
and the gsm building there is a chocolate % uh what you call showroom
% uh sells a lot of chocolates , yah .
okay .
so you can see-
% uh let me just pull a little bit up .
okay , right .
so you can see your hotel now ?
okay , if you were to look downwards onto the % um % uh this street here , middle road ,
you 'll find that fortune centre is here .
next to fortune centre is where % uh the chocolate factory is .
the chocolate showroom is .
you can pick up some more chocolates here .
okay .
yah .
so it 's quite nearby and not only that ,
% uh you are also located whereby you can find lots of % uh heritage
temple heritage % uh what they call % uh heritage land site here .
you can see this one here that i put mouse here ,
the guan yim temple .
the guan yin temple is another temple which is at the % uh-
we call it a buddhist temple .
you can visit there .
% uh and if you like % uh arts
% uh we have the stamford art centre showcase various kind of performing arts there .
% oh okay , so we can probably do those in the morning , right ?
yah .
yes indeed .
that wou~
okay .
because now nearby to your hotel there is a food court or we call it a hawker centre available also .
so you were to walk from your hotel towards this area
where the % uh guan yin temple is .
there is albert centre here .
there is a lots of % uh local % uh food stall where you can find
slightly better and cheaper % uh meal you can get % uh from the hawker centre .
so do must be~
right ?
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
okay .
alright .
yes , okay .
so % uh mathew , i hope you do n't mind if i go back
to the reason why i tried to call you today .
i got ta know the top five things that me and girls can do mostly at night .

and % um have dinner at shazir , i forgot the name of the restaurant .
shazir something like that .
% um it 's a mediterranean food i think or no ,
palestinian food , i 'm not sure .
okay .
so this time around we wan na get drunk .
so where should we go ?
so clarke quay is actually a nice place to visit
during the night time .
% uh huh .
and of course there 's a lot of seafood , % uh there are live bands ,
along the river bend .
% uh you can also enjoy yourself with couple of cans of beer

clarke quay .
right .
yah correct .
so you-
in fact you can % uh be the-
you can go there by % uh transportation through the mrt station .
the ne seven .
% uh let me then show you where i can-
where you can go from here , yah .
alright now you can see % uh on the screen right now
% uh little india very near to your hotel , right ?
yes .
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
yup .
right .
now from little india if you were to take down the train all the way down to dhoby ghaut
then to clarke quay .
can you see clarke quay there ?
% uh no .
where is it at ?
% oh there you go .
got it .
yah .
got it .
% uh it 's quite near .
now-
yah .
yah it 's quite near .
so you see the thing is if you choose the right hotel
% uh going from one place to another is quite easy .
but % uh you also have to bear in mind that the train system only operates at five thirty in the morning
and the last train leave the terminal would be at twelve midnight .
yes .
right .
% oh really ?
we wo n't get drunk until twelve .
so there is cab , right ?
is it like-
okay .
so you know clarke quay .
yes , the cab .
but the cab will charge you an additional surcharge of fifty per cent more .
i know .
yah if it 's midnight .
okay .
we can walk .
is it safe to walk ?
well it 's quite safe to walk ,
but then the thing is % uh you ha~
if you are drunk then % uh i advise you not .
i agree .
good call mathew .
that 's right .
so you can see % uh from here i 'm putting it up the screen it-
% um reduce the screen a little bit
and i try to pull this thing up here and you can-
so that you can see clarke quay .
alright .
huh .
% oh okay .
yah .
% uh the hotel is here the clarke quay .
yes it 's a little bit-
% uh is-
it does n't comes into the map .
yes .
yah it does n't comes into the map .
so anyway % uh the train system that you gon na get down is at clarke quay , right ?
i-
% uh huh .
so you can see this is clarke quay % uh train station ?
can you see clarke quay train station ?
% hm can you try to point it out ?
% oh the-
okay ne five , right ?
here .
now-
ne five , right ?
got it .
now % um from clarke quay % uh station , you can just walk down towards this river bank
and i guess this bridge will a lot % uh more popular to you , right ?
because this is the kingsbridge whereby lots of the % uh people will be drinking
bottles or cans of beer at that time using this bridge .
so it 's pretty nice % uh place to be .
% uh but of course to walk back is a little bit % uh not advisable , % huh .
yes .
yes .
okay .
yes , we might end-up sleeping in the kerb , right ?
yes .
hopefully not .
yes .
so best way is that if you want to back after the midnight ,
you probably you can % uh try to take a cab and there will , yah .
okay .
alright .
so i still need to get one at least one name of restaurant or club in the clarke quay 's trip .
i 'm pretty sure you 've been there ,
so you could probably recommend one at least .
so-
% uh usually i 'll go for shanghai dolly .
shanghai dolly .
okay what should i expect from that place ?
shanghai the , yah .
i know in fact % um it 's pub has a dancing % um ,
you know dancing floor .
you can drink , you can listen to lo~
how much should i % um-
what 's that ?
how much do you think are we gon na spend in this place ?
how about
% uh well that depends on what li~
% uh what drinks you are ordering .
% um let say j√§germeister .
is that too specific ?
okay let 's try beer .
fine .
right .
for example if you 're going for during the happy hour .
% uh probably you 'll buy one you 'll get the next one for free .
that start before nine .
% oh really ?
okay , what time is the happy hour ?
so you have to be there before nine .
yah befo~
seven to nine .
what time is the happy hour ?
seven to nine ?
so if i ordered drinks
% um during happy hour , i get what for free ?
yes .
one for one .
% oh cool .
cool .
so you % uh % er-
if you order a jug of beer , you 'll get another jug of beer free .
so-
% uh huh .
okay .
yah , order-
and that's-
so that means before twelve o'clock , before the wee we're-
yah before nine we should get drunk ,
and we should go home because
we 're gon na lose the train , right ?
before nine .
no .
now before twelve you have
% oh my god .
okay .
that 's too early to get drunk .
so % um here ,
you know , here in the philippines we usually eat something
with the beer or with whatever alcohol we 're having .
huh .
yah or otherwise there is a nice place called the forbidden city .
how about you guys ?
% oh tempting .
okay .
tempting huh .
alright this % uh-
in fact this forbidden city ,
let me just give you the forbidden city here .
yah .
yah , forbidden city .
% uh forbidden city .
alright , forbidden city at clarke quay .
indochine , yah .
here .
so this in fact % uh the forbidden city known as indochine
and it 's coming up on to your screen now .
you can see the party which is happening at indochine .
you can also have your meal first ,
then you have drink ,
then you party .
% oh everything is there , % huh ?
well , yah .
you can see nig~
% oh this does n't look cheap to me .
how much is it to % uh get drunk in this place ?
well about % uh hundred and fifty dollars i think , you should be able to make it for you .
but if you want to-
if you wan na have food there ,
then of course it 's probably gon na be about-
hundred and fifty dollars ?
% oh i visit the- i 'm gon na eat out at
what 's that ?
lucky plaza first and then we go here to get drunk , right ?
so we should be full before getting to this place .
okay .
so a hundred and fifty dollars ,
how many % uh cups or how many cans of beer or wine , whatever you call it
can we consume ?
as i say , you can always go during the happy hour
% uh and pick it up the , what you call , the drinks
before that time .
% uh huh .
% uh that will be a lot more cheaper .
okay , seven to nine drink
and then nine onwards just dance like crazy , right ?
no , because your order from between seven to nine ,
you 'll get to-
you have your drinks on your table .
and that does n't mean say you should finish it before that time .
you can leave it after that time .
% oh okay i got that .
so you order a drink first and for that time
they will serve you the drinks ,
but you do n't finish it up .
you take your time to finish , enjoy the meal ,
music , enjoy the dance .
that should be good enough for you .
% uh huh .
huh .
% oh okay .
alright .
got it .
so we have one-
i think we have two , you 've given me two restaurants .
we have shanghai % um dolly , right ?
is it dolly or deli ?
yes dolly .
okay shanghai dolly and then this one 's indochine .
dol~
okay .
so i think you 've pretty much covered two nights .
we could probably go to shanghai dolly once and then
one night and then indochine the other , right ?
yah or otherwise if you like more rocks and pops
then you probably have to go to saint james powerstation .
where is that at ?
now that is why quite near to the sentosa island
and if you were to take the train towards % uh that area ,
% uh leads you to saint james powerstation which is % um-
you can take the same train from your little india from your hotel to this .
% uh i just give you the-
% uh huh .
okay .
% uh wait
okay .
saint james powerstation .
we call it saint james powerhouse , yah .
% hm okay .
then , right .
saint james powerhouse also have shanghai dolly .
so-
this is at another % um-
what 's this ?
another place , right ?
saint james living room five why
yah .
okay .
there is too much going on in this website that it does n't load .
% uh now you see .
yes , i can see it .
yah .
now you can see the party time ?
% oh i can see ladies free entry daily , % huh ?
yes .
% oh hip hop .
so these are more to hip hops and raps .
% uh huh .
% uh you know .
% uh huh .
so if you are going to saint james powerstation ,
then you get to enjoy % uh three discoth√®que with one admission fees .
okay .
one admission fee , how much is that ?
right .
about % uh % uh twenty five dollars .
and the first drink is free .
okay that 's cheap .
yah .
twenty five dollars , okay .
yah .
so this is-
i think this would be for the younger crowd , right ?
or me , i 'm ju~
not only for the younger crowds
and it is also for middle age .
you can see that there are some other parts are there .
not really meant for the youngers , you see .
you can see that % uh the party time which is there .
these are not-
it 's pretty wild .
yah .
party 's really wild .
% oh there is someone who's-
% uh there 's people performing , right ?
so it 's not just-
correct .
that 's right there 's % uh , yes .
there 's a live band , you know .
so it give you a variety of choice for you to choose from .
so that if you do n't like this pub % uh now
you can go the other pub behind it without paying any cover charge .
okay .
yes .
% oh really .
yah , so that 's why-
so what do you there ?
and so let say for example if you are now enjoying yourself in a % uh pop pub right now ,
% uh the dancing .
then you find it % uh too much of the pounding ,
i ca n't take it .
so i want to go to some classical .
so you can go outta here
% uh huh .
so we go to the temple then , right ?
yah yes .
so without paying a cover charge .
but if you are going to % uh clarke quay and then % uh on different pubs ,
you have to pay cover charge .
alright .
so this is around about three pubs all together
% uh for the price of one .
% uh huh .
yes .
okay .
this one is cool , okay .
and if you like , you can probably % uh try our singapore made zero degrees tiger beer .
% oh what do you call that ?
zero degree ?
we call it zero degrees tiger beer .
% oh is it because it 's too cold ,
that 's why it 's zero deg~
yes , it 's very cold .
% oh okay .
there is pudding also .
are you a beer drinker that 's why you 're % um suggesting that to me ?
in fact i 'm a too ba~
actually i 'm not a drinker but ,
i have tried that particular % uh beer , the tiger beer
a zero degree
tiger beer .
and i find it a little bit much more comfortable .
% uh huh .
% oh okay .
yah .
even i 'm not a drinker but % um
it give me a good sense of , you know , % uh taste .
you get the buzz , right ?
yah .
you do n't drink ?
come on .
no drink .
% uh i am i % uh-
in fact i 'm allergic to alcohol .
so
too bad .
i 'm so sorry to hear that .
everybody must drink alcohol , right ?
yah , you can see from here on your screen right now ,
% um these are the few pubs which is % uh there .
and these are some of the events % uh which is happening at the pub area .
so if you wan na catch that % um % uh performance
you probably come during that particular time to enjoy .
yah .
okay .
yah .
okay .
% um alright .
got those noted .
so % um % uh i guess i 'm okay with the nightlife .
now i do n't know what to do in the morning
and % um i think i have already spent
hundred and fifty let say two hundred fifty dollars on % um entertainment and food
for the evening at least , right ?
% uh what can i do in the morning ?
alright .
in the morning i probably suggest to you to go to singapore botanical garden .
% oh which is one of the nice place that you should not miss .
okay .
beautiful flowers , your ladies friends will love it .
% oh yah .
% oh but % um % uh
you know , when i went there ,
the weather was really bad and very unpredictable like
i need to get the umbrella up my head any time , at any time ,
because of the weather .
how about first week of april ?
i need to plan my outfit , right ?
yah .
yah , but % uh you need not have to worry about the weather
because at most of the time % uh the weather for singapore is like there's-
usually the temperature is around about twenty six degrees to thirty five , thirty six degrees .
quite humid .
the rains come and go within about an hour or two .
okay .
% ah , i do n't wan na get wet .
okay .
okay .
yah , so you need-
even if you-
even if the rain start to fall ,
it will only rain for that particular first or two hours .
that 's it .
then it goes away .
then you can go dance again .
okay .
so we chill somewhere and then we go out again , right ?
yes correct .
and right now the screen is up for the singapore botanical garden .
okay .
yes got it .
right .
you can see that % um it 's free admission ,
so you need not have to pay .
and to get there , i 'm trying to give you % um-
to get there , how to get there .
alright .
% oh it 's free admission .
we then go to this place , okay .
% oh this was free .
good , okay .
yes , alright .
yah , i guess you are happy with the free things , right ?
yes of course .
i 'm gon na eat the flowers there
before lunch time .
botanical garden , okay .
right .
if you were to see that % uh there are some bus service
% uh which will takes you there ,
% uh via bukit timah , you remember the hotel that you are staying at fragrance ?
and now i just pull back this a little bit .
i just pull back to your hotel so that you can see
where i 'm talking about and-
% oh yes please .
i easily get lost .
yah .
okay .
and you can see from here , right ?
this is your hotel , is n't it ?
the fragrance hotel-selegie .
now right in front of your hotel there is a bus stop .
can you see my cursor ?
yes .
right .
this bus stop is heading towards bukit timah towards your-
the singapore botanical garden .
so easily you can get a bus right from there .
now the bus which is available to singapore botanical garden , which i knew of ,
% uh is one seven zero .
you can see bus one seven zero on the screen right now .
% uh there is the public buses , sbs buses ,
and that will takes you there .
probably it will cost you at the most about a dollar for the bus ride .
so the three of you would probably three dollars at the most , yah .
% oh okay .
% oh yes .
but % uh the what you call % uh the singapore botanical garden
opens at five and it close in the middle-
midnight , yah .
opens at five -
and of course-
morning .
five a.m . in the morning .
so you-
% oh my god .
people go to the garden at five in the morning ?
they went for jogging-
they went for jogging they jog with their dogs and they jog with their loved ones
in the early morning , right .
so the park is open in the early morning and of course % uh
if you go to botanical garden ,
then i will say that you should not miss the national orchid garden .
it 's so beautiful inside there .
we have lots of orchids there .
and of course % uh is-
there are lot of % um celebrity orchids are
also % um placed inside the national orchid garden .
and one of the % uh orchids that you should not miss is also nelson mandela orchid .
okay .
% uh huh .
yes .
alright .
% uh huh .
% oh okay .
% oh nelson mandela orchid .
yah .
his name are-
nelson mandela .
okay , really ?
right .
yes and we also have the % um your president aquino .
and that she also have a flower named after her .
% oh cool , it 's yellow i bet , right ?
inside the sa~
yah .
okay .
yah you can go there also , right ?
yes .
okay .
you can take some nice photograph of it , yah .
this is one good place to go to and then
probably gon na go get brunch after .
is there a restaurant somewhere near % um the botanical garden ?
yah .
yes , there is .
where you can have your meal , yah .
% oh yah , nice .
yah .
okay .
you can see there are so many restaurants located
inside the % uh botanical garden .
how much is it gon na cost us for the lunch like % uh one course ?
% uh estimated price for one lunch
will probably around about twenty to thirty dollars
for % uh-
twenty to thirty dollars .
okay wait .
yah because you are going to a restaurant .
you are not going to a food court .
okay .
you know i 'm just kinda wondering because
when i last went there ,
every time i sit down with my brother and my sister-in-law ,
we always spend like % uh sixty % uh what 's that six~
singaporean dollars .
that 's quite-
that 's expensive , right ?
yah .
% uh that is because you are having three person , right ?
% oh yah , that 's for three persons .
% uh i see .
so i said twenty dollars per person .
% oh my god .
wait a minute .
so this one % um how much is it-
how much i 'm gon na spend again for this place
when i want to have a lunch in the-
what 's this ?
% uh as i said that % uh the lunch wise ,
you had to put something aside like twenty five dollars to thirty dollars per person
because you are dining in a restaurant .
you are not dining in a food court .
% uh % oh my god .
this is so expensive .
okay fine .
yah otherwise what you can do is you-
what you can do is you can walk across the other side of the street
and have hawker food .
or you can also a very cheap food there .
now let me see , i remember there is a food court available
inside the botanical garden .
% oh yes .
yah .
there you go .
food court i can understand .
yah .
yah .
you can see % uh there 's a food court % uh there .
% uh huh .
just give me a minute huh the-
i give you the food court here .
alright .
yah we have a new food court % uh inside the % uh singapore botanical garden .
% uh there you are .
that 's the food for thought , yah .
located in .
can you see ?
% uh huh .
% oh okay .
% oh there is no picture it 's because it 's cheap huh ?
okay .
fine .
% uh you know what , % uh % huh .
yah .
yah correct .
alright .
so these are-
those are good-
% uh there are good place there you can find cheap food as well ,
but that also depends on you di~
yes , 'cause i only have a thousand % um dollars , right ?
i guess that 's fine maybe at night we splurge but
not in the morning , right ?
maybe it 's okay to be a little cheap , right ?
okay .
so i have one question for you .
i need you to be totally honest with me % um mathew .
is my one thousand dollars enough for two days ?
am i gon na % um survive or if i get lost ,
will i still survive at one thousand % um singaporean dollars ?
yah .
% uh yah .
% uh yes , i would say yes .
you should not be having any problem with that one thousand dollars
unless you wan na give free drinks to everybody .
okay .
% oh no way .
see , i 'm gon na kick one of the friends , right ?
all of it .
% uh you should give a free treat to me because
okay. ,
% oh yah , you know what , you do n't drink so you 're really cheap date .
i can just probably get you % um what you call that coffee ?
kopi-o cof~
okay .
yah i will just get you one kopi-o for a cent or two , right ?
no probably i should demand for ben and jerry .
% oh what 's that again ?
ben and jerry 's .
% oh yah , what 's that ?
ice cream .
ice cream % oh yes .
lots of singaporeans love that .
% oh and % um i 'm probably gon na get two or three of snicker % um ice cream bar ,
'cause there is none here in the philippines .
yah .
yah it 's here .
you can get it from here .
right .
right .
yes , okay .
so i guess i 'm cool with this .
i 've % um one , two , three , four places .
and % um since you already told me
that one thousand singaporean dollars is gon na last me ,
we 'll just probably be spontaneous .
i have a hotel , i guess we 're all good .
do you have any more tips for me ?
yah .
% uh what do yo~
what else would you want ?
% okay , i was kinda think-
% uh yes ?
i guess that one thousand dollar should be just nice for you , yah .
yes .
as much as i wan na do more , i only have a few .
% oh no , i do n't have enough money that 's why .
right ?
yah .
% uh yah because you are going to % uh pubs ,
% uh to have drinks ,
so you have to allocate that separately , yah .
right .
exactly .
yah .
okay .
that 's it .
i guess i have nothing else to ask you , mathew .
i have to say goodbye now .
i need to thank you for your time .
and % uh try to get a drink , come on .
okay .
okay .
okay .
yap .
no proble~
% uh okay i 'll try .
alright , bye .
so i wait for your time to come , yah .
okay .
'cause you actually have any % uh more query you can
feel free to call me again .
okay .
% oh sure .
alright .
okay , bye .
thank you .
bye .
thank-
