yes .
and you were saying that you wanted to come to singapore .
% uh maybe can i have a little bit more details like % uh when will you be coming ?
and like who will you be coming with ?
% uh yes .
% um i 'm actually planning to visit
% uh on august .
alright .
% uh and i 'm planning to take with me my husband and my son .
alright .
and how old is your son ?
% uh my son is actually turning ten .
% uh i 'm % uh-
we 're planning to go to singapore on his birthday .
that 's actually his birthday , august twenty sixth .
okay .
so % um-
yah , so i 'm planning to take him there .
a sort of like a birthday gift .
okay , that 's good .
that 's a very nice birthday gift .
yes .
okay .
and how many days will you be % uh spending in singapore ?
% uh actually it would be just for a one day stopover .
okay .
so % um i'm-
what i want is to % uh seek advice from you like
how we can % um actually maximise that .
% uh huh .
and is this your first time to singapore ?
% uh yes , it is .
okay .
alright .
and has any of your friends or relatives came to singapore before ?
% uh yes , i 've had a couple of % uh friends or officemates who actually , you know , who 've been to singapore before .
but i have n't gotten really much % um information from them .
okay , you will be arriving at singapore
on the twenty fifth , i guess ?
so that you can spend twenty sixth of august here .
yah .
oh yah , that would be great .
alright .
and % um you will be taking a flight in % uh
do you also need me to like advise you how do you get from the airport
and i presume you 'll be staying in a hotel as well ?
% uh yes please .
that will be great since it 's my first time so , you know , i need directions .
okay , and you will probably leave singapore on the twenty seventh ?
right .
correct .
okay .
alright .
okay , so % uh what are your son like
any theme park or what is he like ?
what does he prefer ?
yah .
what i 'm planning to do is actually to take him to % um
% uh universal studios .
yes .
% um that 's % uh-
that would be my sort of % um gift to him .
% uh okay .
and your husband , does he like % uh
what kind of food does he like then ?
% um me and my husband actually , that 's really our main % uh goal
why we want to go to singapore is really % um to really try out the food .
% um i think any-
% uh we really want to try out like maybe the signature % um dishes in singapore .
like , you know , it 's like if you 've been to singapore , you have to really taste this or eat this .
alright .
okay .
like-
like chili crabs ?
yes .
if-
is that the signature dish of singapore ?
okay .
% uh yes .
because % uh a lot of people likes to eat this food including the local people as well .
okay .
okay .
% um and of course % uh pepper crabs as well .
okay .
% uh so i think we-
the locals here generally , if we have friends coming over-
we like to introduce them to these % uh dishes .
okay .
% um i actually want to try out
because % uh i 've watched in the television like asian food network over here that there are a lot of % um-
i think they call it the hawker % um-
yes .
it's-
yah .
i will-
the hawker food ?
yes .
okay .
yah , maybe you could also , you know , give us an idea on
you know , where we should go to , you know , have a try on that place ?
right .
okay .
and-
alright , maybe i can do a recommendation now .
okay .
% um okay , if like if you arrived in the airport
we have three terminals at the moment .
% um so you probably arrive let 's say terminal one , changi airport .
okay .
that 's located on the eastern part of singapore .
and you will be checking in to the hotel .
let 's say if you are putting up in the orchard road hotel .
% uh that is like about thirty minutes ' drive by taxi to the orchard road hotels .
okay .
so there are quite a number of hotels there .
so again it depends on your budget .
it 's like one straight road .
okay .
and that 's very convenient because we have the subway train station out there .
as well as the % uh buses and it is also the main shopping belt .
okay .
okay .
can i-
all items-
yes ?
% um i 'm sorry .
go ahead .
% uh i was-
okay .
% uh so i was thinking also maybe % uh since you have only one day in singapore
you could also try taking the subway % uh to your hotel which we call it the mrt .
oh yah , i 've heard about that .
and % uh-
mrt .
okay .
correct .
so what you can do is once you arrived in the airport , you can go to the subway train station .
you just look for direction .
it 's pretty clear .
% uh you look for the direction that says % uh city train .
and you go down % uh to the train station and you can buy % uh a tourist card .
or-
okay , since it 's only one day , i think what you can do is you just buy a standard card .
% uh on this train , it 's actually % uh east-west line .
okay .
okay .
so this is % um from the east , you 'll be travelling down to city hall mrt train station .
okay .
so i think maybe the easiest since you only have one day
i would recommend that you stay in the % uh city hall .
there are two hotels there for you to choose .
okay .
% um may i have a-
do you have an idea , lynnette , like how much does it cost in that hotel ?
okay .
% uh it 's about in the region of singapore dollars .
% uh three hundred dollars per room .
oh okay .
% um because here 's the thing .
% um i only actually have one thousand -
alright .
% um singaporean dollar .
so % um let 's say that % um given my budget , so maybe i have to % um have more money for-
but if it would be me , my husband and my son , that would be considered as a package tour , right ?
% uh not necessary .
okay .
you can actually just come in , take the subway to the hotel .
and % uh you can do a one way tour
and i will do a few recommendation for you % uh so you do n't have to spend that much money .
okay .
okay .
so let 's say it 's % uh the three of us and then i only have one thousand dollars .
so let 's % um so if we do with the hotel which cost you said three hundred dollars , right ?
yes ?
right .
okay .
so the three hundred dollars is already good for the three of us if like we stay in one room ?
yes .
okay .
and then we 'll % uh-
i think we 'll just go ahead and take the subway then
because i think that 's much cheaper if % uh compared to riding a taxi , correct ?
yes .
because the taxi ride from the airport to the orchard road will probably cost you about-
again depending on the timing that you have arrive ,
% uh in the region of let 's say forty dollars -
singapore dollars .
so all the prices i 'm quoting you will be in singapore dollars .
okay .
so mrt , you mentioned that i just have to buy a standard card .
yes .
okay . and how much does the standard card % um cost ?
okay . and how much does the standard card % um cost ?
okay .
it depends on which % uh particular location that you are going to .
okay .
% uh so let 's say we will have to choose .
let 's say now maybe i 'll just talk to you first before i show you the map , the city map .
% uh and also some hotels .
okay , sure .
alright .
so it all depends , alright .
the mrt ride ranges from about two dollars % uh to-
let 's say three dollars .
but because if you are buying a standard card , there is actually a dollar deposit .
okay .
so let 's say if the taxi -
the mrt cost one dollar for example , then you will have to put two dollars into the machine .
okay .
yah .
so i will suggest that when you are-
let 's say your husband is trying to get-
% uh retrieve the bags % uh at the conveyor belt .
at the belts .
% uh there are also money changer inside % uh the airport area .
okay .
so maybe one can take care of the bags .
% uh the other person will go and change some money first .
some singapore money .
okay .
just % uh change a little bit of money just for your meals
in the hotel % uh in the hawker centres .
alright .
as well as for the ride to the hotel .
okay .
alright .
so i estimated .
maybe you can change about singapore dollars , two hundred dollars first .
alright .
two hundred dollars first .
yah .
% uh or anything more but i think this is just for my recommendation .
just some money to get by for the short while .
you can always change money in the hotel with the hotel cashier .
okay .
or if you 're going to stay in near any of the shopping centres % uh there 's always a money changer in the shopping centre .
so you can always change your money there .
okay .
got it .
thank you .
yah .
and if you are spending let 's say money in the % uh shopping centre
% uh or buying tickets to universal studio , you can always pay them with credit cards .
okay .
yah .
so i think the most % uh advisable time for us to arrive is really in the morning , right ?
so that we could have all afternoon and stay there up until % um the night ?
is that a good time ?
yes .
right .
so i mean if you are going to-
because it 's a short flight from philippines , so you can arrive in the morning on saturday % uh
on the twenty sixth % uh and then you stay overnight the next day .
oh .
okay .
yah .
or of course if you can have a bit more time , you can arrive prior to twenty sixth , twenty fifth .
and then you leave on the twenty seventh .
% uh % hm yah
i think i 'll go with the twenty fifth and then will have , you know % um twenty sixth .
yes .
and then , yah , leave on the twenty seventh .
i think that 's much better .
yah .
okay .
so you will have like a two night stay in singapore .
% uh % hm right .
okay .
% uh so from the hotel , okay , so % um you mentioned that it 's only thirty minutes % uh from the hotel to get to-
i mean from the airport to get to the hotel , is that correct ?
okay , from-
if you 're taking the subway -
% uh because this is a east-west line % um you will have to change % uh the line in city hall .
% uh so i think better that you reserve forty five minutes .
oh .
okay .
forty five minutes , that 's fine .
yah .
alright .
it 's pretty frequent .
% uh so of course to be very detailed .
% uh always check with the information counter at the mrt train station .
we call our subway the mrt .
yah .
okay .
so there are like certain hotels you can stay .
% uh maybe the landmark hotel over at the-
near to the bugis area .
okay .
landmark hotel .
yah .
and % um this is-
do we-
do you-
would you consider this % uh as more of a like a child friendly or a family % uh friendly type of a hotel ?
you know given that i have a kid with me .
% um okay .
this is just a normal kind of a hotel .
okay .
% uh so they do have % uh quite a lot of family staying in this hotel as well .
okay , good .
% uh yah .
so i do n't think you will require like any special % uh items for the-
for your child , right ?
because the whole day you 'll be out .
% uh yah .
correct , yah .
yah .
okay .
so % um let 's say % uh if we arrived already at the hotel
yes ?
so % um from there , we can already like maybe go to universal studios .
is that near this hotel ?
% uh yah , it 's pretty convenient
because again , you can take the subway .
so what you do is-
okay , let 's say we skip the arrival part , right ?
i mean that 's done , right ?
you are quite % uh you know what 's going on from your airport , you take the subway-
alright .
to the hotel .
alright .
and % uh so let 's say we start on the twenty sixth .
okay .
twenty sixth .
i 'll begin first , for breakfast .
try some local food .
yes , on the twenty sixth itself .
% uh of course if you want to have the hotel breakfast , you can always-
because most of the time , breakfast will be included in your hotel package .
yes .
alright .
okay .
if you decide not to do it , not to take the hotel breakfast .
i would suggest that you come out from the hotel .
just go across the road .
there is a little % uh coffee shop .
do you take spicy food ?
i actually love spicy food .
oh that 's great .
% uh yah .
i 've been to india before so % um yah , i actually-
i like it .
okay .
so what you can do is you just go across the road .
there are small cafes just across your road-
the road .
and % uh there is quite a famous i would say % uh roti prata store .
it 's % uh what they serve is like pancake -
okay .
but it 's an indian pancake .
oh cool .
yah .
and % uh-
i 'd like to try that .
yah .
so you can try that .
and they have another dish called murtabak .
it has all kind of fillings in there ; chicken -
% uh beef , % uh even sardine .
alright .
and
they pan fry it .
it 's a dough , they pan fry it .
and you can eat it with your hands just like the locals .
okay .
right .
it 's a piece of pancake .
you tear out into small pieces and you dip them in curry .
oh cool .
but of course if you do n't want , you can always use the spo~ and-
oh fork and spoon .
okay .
alright .
so you can have that for breakfast , it 's quite a filling dish .
so maybe i 'll suggest that % uh a one piece , it depends on what kind of meat you order .
it ranges from five dollars -
singapore dollars onwards .
okay .
so you can order just two pieces to try or maybe you can try that .
and you can also % uh do a bee hoon goreng .
it 's like fried % uh noodles .
okay .
but it 's malay style .
alright .
alright .
okay .
so you just order a small-
% uh two dish is fine for 3 person .
oh alright .
so the serving is actually % um quite big .
alright .
quite-
big .
yes , it 's quite big .
and you can also have % uh one of our tea .
like a teh tarik kind of a tea .
% um it 's like a pull tea .
okay .
alright .
okay .
tea with milk and they pull the tea .
so you have a lot of foam on your tea .
so that is-
this is something very local as well .
alright .
yes , so you can have that .
and then you just walk towards the subway
% uh which will be the bugis mrt .
okay .
it 's about seven minutes ' walk .
and you take the subway % uh to the harbourfront .
alright .
% um i 'm just concerned .
% um well singapore , i think majority % uh of the people there % uh are already english % um speakers , right ?
so if we ask for direction % um or or , you know , instructions or something like that .
so we would be able to % uh communicate with them okay ?
okay .
yes , no problem .
% uh majority of us here speaks english
% uh because english is our first language and all our sign are all in english .
okay , good .
yes .
so if there 's any % uh problem , you need directions , please feel free to approach anybody that looks like a local .
alright .
okay .
i think there 's some-
yah .
'cause i do n't , you know , i'm-
we might have a difficult time , right ?
% um communicating .
so that 's good that % uh we will be able-
the majority of the people % uh can speak english so-
alright .
great .
yah , so it 's not a real issue .
% uh okay , the mrt again % uh i would suggest that % uh you take a map of the mrt
so that you have a better idea how to travel .
okay .
because again % uh from your hotel to the % uh-
to harbourfront where you 're going to-
i would say that i think you 'll just do universal studio on sentosa on the twenty sixth .
so you will have to change your mrt ride over at dhoby ghaut
because that will be the % uh north east line .
north east .
okay .
yah .
so i think the detailed part , i think we should-
you should be able to work it out , right ?
% um yah .
so if i go to the mrt and then i just have to tell-
% uh i just would have to identify on which % uh station , is that what you call it ?
on which station i-
we should be % um going ?
yah .
yes .
and then-
% uh okay no .
all our mrt , we have this map out there .
we have a map .
oh .
alright .
okay .
let me try and get you the % uh mrt map .
so there are a few lines
okay , from the airport is the east to the west line in jurong .
then we have the north to the south line .
and we have another line , the north east line .
% uh and a circle line .
right now these are % uh the lines that 's available .
okay .
so once you get down to the mrt , % uh you will be able to see % uh the map .
okay , i have opened up the % uh mrt lines for you to see .
would you be able-
do you-
were you-
are you able to copy that ?
% um % uh i 'm not able to see it on my % um screen yet .
okay .
% um i think % uh you have to share that with me for me to able to see it on my screen over here .
alright .
% uh okay .
can you see the east side ?
the green colour line ?
% hm , no .
i 'm not seeing anything yet on my screen over here .
you 're not seeing anything .
% uh would you be able-
nothing at all ?
yah .
yah , nothing .
okay .
the-
alright , okay .
the changi side is on the east .
it 's on the green line .
okay .
okay , can you see now ?
% uh okay .
it 's starting to download .
% uh alright .
yes , i can see it now .
alright .
okay .
can you see the green line ?
okay .
% uh yes .
okay .
can you see on the right-hand side ?
it says number three changi airport .
yes .
alright .
so that is actually the east west line .
so can you follow towards your left-hand side ?
okay .
my left hand-
% uh to the left .
and then you-
yah , the green line go to the left .
to the left ?
alright .
okay .
and then you will see city hall .
city hall , let me check that .
where is that ?
just go to the left .
so from changi .
okay .
changi , you will see expo .
expo , right .
yes .
and then you will see bedok , kembangan all the rest .
just follow the green line .
alright .
okay .
okay .
% uh and you will come to bugis .
oh there , i see it now .
i see city hall .
yes .
yah .
okay .
alright .
okay .
so you can stay in this hotel called landmark .
okay .
or alternatively , there is another hotel which is very convenient , just lavender .
lavender ?
yes , just before bugis .
okay .
yah , there 's another hotel there .
it 's called v hotel .
it 's called a new-
v % uh victory .
v ?
v-
alright , v hotel .
yeah .
yah .
so you can stay there as well .
it's-
i think these two locations are pretty convenient .
at least , you know , you do n't have to change lines .
oh .
right , i agree .
well from the airport , yes , all the way and
v hotel is just directly next to the lavender hotel -
% uh mrt .
right , yah .
i think that's-
so once you come out-
yah , once you come out the hotel , it 's there .
yah , i think that 's much-
a much better option-
okay .
for convenience .
yah .
and like i said-
again breakfast time , no issue .
% uh just outside your hotel , there are lots of eating places .
and you can get a breakfast for % uh
there 's a food court .
a food court is an air-conditioned % uh it 's a modern version of the non air-conditioned hawker centres .
ok-
oh okay .
yah .
so you can choose like if you want % uh just drinks , you want chinese food , you want fried noodles .
so you can do that for your breakfast and then you carry on your tour to sentosa .
but-
right .
yah , alright .
so sentosa % uh-
alright .
so let 's say we 're done with breakfast .
so we 're going-
where is universal studios here ?
alright .
is it also along with the green lines ?
okay , then so-
okay , you will have to change your train at % uh city hall .
okay .
okay , and after that you will have to change to the red line .
% hm alright .
okay , can you see city hall ?
and then you go up .
up , alright .
yah .
and then you see dhoby ghaut ?
% uh let me-
just one station .
dhoby , there , yes , i saw it .
yes .
okay , and from there , you change to the purple line .
purple line .
is that also in the red one or the-
oh the purple line .
yah .
okay .
purple line .
so you go downwards .
alright .
downwards .
oh .
downwards here .
you 'll see clarke quay , chinatown and-
correct .
and % uh harbour -
yah , harbourfront .
harbourfront .
yah .
so you will alight at harbourfront .
okay .
okay .
so i think i will not confuse you with telling you all the cost of the mrt ride .
what you do is when you get down at the mrt , you just-
you know , there will be machine .
it 's very easy to operate .
you just press like which direction-
which station you are going to .
press harbourfront -
okay .
and the machine will tell you how much to pay .
alright .
so when you are taking the subway , please remember to take a small singapore money with you .
okay .
alright .
like a five dollars kind of and a two dollars and some coins .
okay .
alright ?
there is change given but they accept the smaller notes .
yup .
okay .
yah .
so you alight at harbourfront .
okay .
and from harbourfront % uh you can take the cable car -
okay .
inside sentosa .
inside sentosa .
yah .
% um do we have to pay for that as well ?
yes .
the cable car ride % uh i will suggest that you take like % uh one way .
% uh it 's about twelve dollars .
okay ?
per person .
and then once you 're in sentosa -
and also please remember to pack a change of clothes and also like maybe swimming gear as well .
okay .
okay .
why ?
oh okay .
because if you have time , you can go swimming in our beautiful lagoon on sentosa .
oh cool .
nice .
alright .
yah , and in case , you know , your son play some of the games , he may get wet .
so i think-
yah , please bring a change of clothes .
alright .
thank you .
okay huh .
so what you do is like if you are going early in the morning
i suggest you go to a short while to the beach .
yah .
and on sen-
yah , i would like that .
yah .
on sentosa itself , you can go on the % uh-
okay , i 'll close this % uh mrt % uh map .
alright , sure .
and then i will show you the sentosa map .
okay .
you can get by using the buses on sentosa .
% uh and the buses that operates on sentosa were-
% uh they are free .
alright , they are already included in your fare .
oh .
alright .
that 's nice .
so sentosa is actually % um
because i 'm seeing your screen right now .
so it 's actually an island .
yes , it 's an island just about one kilometre away from the mainland .
% uh it 's on the southern part of singapore .
so i think now you can see the map , the whole map now .
% uh yes .
okay .
can you see something blinking in the top left corner ?
% uh blinking top left corner .
yes .
okay , and you see % uh tall tower and then there 's something down that has a little bit of u .
right .
okay , can you see my arrow ?
yes , i can .
this arrow ?
okay , so you can take the cable car , alright , across .
okay , that is optional .
so let 's see how you-
we , you know , oh after you-
i think , yah , that 's a nice ride here .
okay , and on sentosa , you see all these roads ?
okay .
% uh you can travel on the buses-
sentosa buses .
okay .
okay , and they are colour coded as well .
but % uh again you just look at where you are going to .
alright .
so i would suggest that you go to the lagoon .
okay , can you see siloso beach ?
can you see my arrow ?
yes , i can .
okay .
so you can do the beach out here for early morning swim .
that 's nice .
yes , spend about % uh one hour .
alright .
and then you can go to universal studio .
alright .
so universal studios is actually within sentosa ?
yes , it 's on sentosa itself .
can you see resort world ?
oh .
yes .
yah .
so it 's actually over this side .
nice , alright .
okay , and of course it 's like a theme park .
so you can see % uh you know , you can basically spend like three quarter of a day or almost a day -
% uh in the park and % uh you can do a lot of attractions there .
alright .
% um so the ticket , we have to buy it on the place itself ?
% uh you can also buy % uh online before you arrive .
okay .
so we can buy it online as well .
yes .
and do you have an idea how much would the ticket cost ?
okay .
% uh a day pass for the adult will cost singapore dollars , sixty six dollars .
% uh and a child will be forty eight dollars .
okay .
sixty six -
yah .
and forty eight .
but % um-
okay .
but just to check again , let me see .
the date twenty sixth august , is that a weekday or weekend ?
okay .
so there 's a-
yah , there 's a difference in the price when-
if it 's a weekday or a weekend .
yes , correct .
so like at weekend , it will be at seventy two dollars for the adult and a child will be fifty two dollars .
okay .
so let's-
okay .
let me just check .
twenty sixth august .
it 's a sunday .
sure .
that 's nice .
yes .
but that's-
but it 's much-
but the price is % uh a bit higher .
but that 's fine .
yah , it 's fine .
it 's just a few dollars difference .
yah , it 's a few dollars .
and it 's a birthday gift .
it 's a birthday treat .
right .
yah .
correct .
okay .
okay .
so you can do % uh-
% uh there are quite a few shows there as well .
there are few shows that you can do .
% uh there 's a madagascar , there is this % uh the ride in the movie , transformer .
i think your son will like that .
the ride , transformer .
definitely .
my son and my husband are actually fans of transformers .
so i 'm sure they will like that .
% uh okay .
yes .
so that is a nice % uh ride to do .
% uh and of course , there are other shows and-
i think i will suggest that lunch , you just have a meal in universal studio itself .
okay .
because , you know , it takes time to come out and then go in again .
so i 'll just-
i will suggest that lunch , you have it in universal studio .
so they have like fast food available .
% uh to local food as well .
% uh so maybe just a quick lunch like a sandwich or something .
okay .
and then carry on .
depending on how much % uh your son would like to stay in there .
okay .
how much time he wants to spend there , right ?
yes .
okay .
so because the % uh universal studio opening hours , it 's from
ten a.m. to seven p.m .
okay .
alright .
yah .
so maybe , you know , we could stay there for like-
% um i 'm not sure .
maybe five to , you know , six hours .
something like that .
yah .
that 's right .
so you could spend like let 's say from ten o'clock , you know , if you go early in the morning for your swim .
or even if you do n't want to swim , just take a walk in the bea-
% uh in-
around the beach area .
and then you just take a sentosa bus to the universal studio or you can also take the % uh
what do you call that ?
the train on sentosa itself .
okay .
alright .
% uh those are all included so you do n't have to pay extra money .
% uh then you go to universal studio
spend let 's say from ten or ten thirty onwards right up to about five thirty .
yah .
or even six .
and then you go for your dinner with the chili crabs .
yah , great .
alright .
so from there , you-
again you can take the subway to the clarke quay .
from harbourfront to clarke quay .
i think-
oh .
okay , there are quite a few restaurants there .
% uh and you can have your chili crabs out there .
okay , great .
% um what about for % uh you know , shopping .
% uh because i think one % um
singapore is also % um popular with-
when it comes to-
because you know , we 're about to go home already , right ?
because we 're done with dinner and we have-
before we leave , so we have to shop .
so % um i know that singapore is very popular when it comes to gadgets .
right .
yes .
right .
% um because i 've heard from my friends that
you can actually buy like gadgets in singapore % uh for a much cheaper price .
and also the quality is really good .
so % um do you know for a place wherein , you know , my husband
because he 's a techy person ,
right .
my husband can go and maybe , you know , check for cell phones , laptop or ipad , something like that ?
alright , you can go to this place .
% uh again if you 're going to stay in the lavender mrt area .
% uh it 's just like two station away from where you are .
% um you go to funan centre .
okay .
yah .
% uh they have all the gadgets out there .
so maybe if you-
before you come , you know , you can always check on the prices first .
okay .
and % uh because there are so many shops out there that sells similar items , so they are pretty-
% uh i would say very attractive prices .
okay .
so it 's like a one % uh stop shop for like different gadgets .
okay .
yah .
yah .
so there 's also competition going on between % um the sellers there .
yes , so what you-
maybe they may not be able to give you like a lot of discount .
% uh but they can always give you freebies
because they know that if you go into the shop and you walked out
you 'll probably end up buying from someone else .
alright .
okay .
so it 's quite reputable , the shops there .
so i will recommend like this location
so you can do your shopping out there .
and let 's say your-
you can leave your husband there for yourself-
oh yourself or-
i 'm sorry , your husband and your son if your son is interested in a technical product .
then what you do is you walk over to city hall mrt .
yes .
correct .
and you do your shopping out there .
our shops are open until nine thirty .
okay .
so you-
because you 're just ten minutes away from one another .
oh that 's nice .
so we can actually separate from each other and i can do my own shopping .
yah .
yah .
so % um here you have like clothes % uh you know , shoes , bags , all those stuff .
yes .
so you have-
% uh in the raffles place -
% uh sorry , raffles city
because it 's just above the city hall mrt .
% uh they have from the branded ,
alright , like the gucci and everything else .
right up to the midrange products .
right .
so it 's % uh about three three levels of shopping .
and also we have an underground shopping area % uh called citylink .
okay , citylink .
alright .
so they have all-
yes , they have all your shoes , your clothes .
the ladies , the gents .
toiletries , cosmetics , everything is in there .
okay .
alright .
and how 's the price ?
% um is it like % um somewhat similar to % um hong kong or you could say that it 's actually much cheaper ?
it 's different because the quality here % uh is better , i would say .
it 's not like the street kind of % uh shopping .
they are shops .
so the quality is good i would say .
so it all depends .
let 's say if you are buying the branded product , i think here in singapore , we are still relatively affordable .
okay .
okay .
% uh and % uh if you are buying the midrange products
% uh they are in % uh i would say a good condition .
okay .
great .
alright .
and on top of that , you can always claim back the gst , the goods and services tax .
% hm alright .
which is like % uh seven per cent .
and it 's so easy , you know ?
you-
once you arrived back in the airport when you are leaving singapore
you just produce the receipt that has been stamped
% uh sorry .
% uh that is given by the retailer .
and let 's say if you are putting your purchases in your luggage ,
so you have that checked by % uh officials before you check in your bags .
okay .
% hm okay .
alright .
so if you are buying smaller items like % uh jewellery , watches
then you can have your % uh gst refund % um just before you board the plane .
once you cleared the immigration , you look out for this sign that says gst
and you can claim back your money immediately if you like .
in whatever currency you like .
or you can even charge that back to your card and they will mail back the % uh refund to you
when you 're back in the philippines .
wow , that 's actually nice .
alright .
yah .
yah , so it 's very convenient .
yah , i like that .
yes , so i think for one day , you may not have that much time % uh to do your shopping but % uh-
so i suggest like let 's say you come out from sentosa about five thirty .
you can have your dinner .
okay .
alright .
or you can even % uh let 's say to save time , you can even spe-
have your dinner in vivocity .
okay .
alright .
because when you 're at universal studio , you take the sentosa train out
you 're already at vivocity .
vivo ?
vivo , v i v o .
okay , vivocity .
yah .
so let 's see .
okay .
that 's also within sentosa , right ?
% uh it 's just out of % uh sentosa .
okay .
so what you do is when you 're finished with sentosa
let 's say i suggest about five thirty , right ?
% uh you just take the sentosa train .
and you will be out in this big shopping centre .
there are lots of restaurants out there -
and you can-
okay .
okay .
okay .
so this is like a mall ?
okay .
yes , it 's a shopping mall .
% uh again-
it 's a shopping mall .
yes .
so if you do n't want to get out of this place , you can also do your shopping out here .
okay .
% uh and % uh-
but since your husband wants to do the tech product
so i think i would suggest that you have your dinner there .
and then proceed to % uh funan centre .
okay .
yah , to get his products .
okay .
or alternatively you can do this in the morning
% uh before you go on to sentosa island .
alright .
okay .
so-
yah , because the shops will open like % uh ten thirty in the morning .
so you can-
for funan % uh about ten thirty , eleven .
so you can go from % uh funan .
funan ?
do a bit-
yes .
so allocate let 's say about one hour-
okay .
shopping time for him .
and then you go on to sentosa , let 's say at about % uh in the afternoon .
one o'clock , twelve o'clock .
you 'll be in sentosa .
okay , you can do your lunch again if you are doing funan
you can go down to the hawker centre in the basement area .
have your food .
and then go to sentosa .
yah .
okay .
so that's-
thank you for giving me a lot of % uh options .
but then-
yah .
okay , i hope you have an idea now how to plan .
yah .
% um lynnette , just % uh one more question .
because i saw a while ago % uh while we were in that sentosa park
% um that there was also something mentioned there about like spas .
okay .
% um so % uh like within sentosa , there are also places where i can-
like maybe get a massage or , you know , something like that ?
yes .
there is a spa there as well .
% uh so while your kids are enjoying and your husband enjoying their time in universal
you can go for your spa .
okay .
alright .
so that 's also-
is that outside universal or within universal ?
it 's outside universal .
oh okay .
yah .
alright .
okay .
or alternatively if your husband is doing his shopping down in funan
you can always get your spa done
% uh at the % uh nearby % uh hotel area .
there are some spas there as well .
okay .
yah .
and % um the price range .
sorry 'cause i 'm , you know , i 'm % um budget conscious .
and the price range % uh could you give me an idea on that ?
yah , alright .
yes .
% uh i-
you know , if i-
just the full body or just % uh the legs ?
the feet .
yah , maybe like a full body massage .
like , you know , from like thirty minutes to an hour of that .
how much would that cost ?
okay , approximately about a hundred dollars .
okay .
yah .
hundred dollars .
yes .
alright .
okay .
so % um-
okay i think tentatively that 's what i can suggest since it 's like a one day programme .
% uh so i hope you got an idea now .
% um yes , i did .
actually it 's very % um informative .
so thank you for giving me a lot of options .
% um so again just another question .
yes ?
what about in terms of giving like tips ?
% uh oh yah .
so % um how-
what 's your % um suggestion on that ?
okay % uh in singapore we do n't really practice % uh giving of tips
but of course if you 're very happy with the service % uh you 're welcome to do so .
but otherwise we % uh do n't have a compulsory tipping but if you 're in the-
% uh if you 're having your meals in the restaurants , they do have a service charge there already .
oh .
okay .
so it 's not really % um a requirement to give , you know , tips and all that .
yah , it 's not compulsory .
okay .
got it .
yah .
okay .
alright .
alright .
so thank you .
yah ?
yah .
that 's basically it .
thank you so much lynnette .
% um this is very helpful .
alright .
welcome .
alright .
thank you .
okay .
bye .
okay .
bye .
hi , good morning .
hello good morning ,
this is participant two .
hi , this is % uh tour guide % uh one
my name is lynnette
and can i get your name ?
% uh hello , my name is marissa
and i 'm planning % um a tour in singapore
for maybe % um a day or two but probably % um-
it 's maybe a couple of days .
okay .
so can i say about three days ?
yes .
% hm , i think % um , yah
maybe maximum of three days .
okay .
and melissa , % uh when would you be-
% uh which period of time are you coming in ?
yah .
% um i think that would be on % um first week of april .
first week of april , that 's pretty soon , % uh ?
yah because % uh that would be % um a holiday here in our country
so it would give me time to you know relax also from work .
okay .
alright .
so melissa % um in order for me to help you to plan your stay in singapore
% uh would you be able to give me some details
like how many % uh like who will you be coming with
and you know , is there any special thing that you 'd like to do here ?
well i think i 'll be bringing % um a couple of my friends .
i think my two best friends are also interested to come in with me .
% um we like to , you know-
we are very % um-
we three are % um we like to eat
so we would like to explore the cuisine , singaporean cuisine
and also % um see % um beautiful spots there
and also where we could % um shop and also relax .
so do you think % um three days would suffice for us to do all that ?
also one of my friend % um she likes to do , you know % um something extreme
like % uh she likes wall climbing and do para~
% um zip lining .
parasailing .
% uh yah .
did you have that also ?
okay .
alright .
so the-
well of course if you can spare five times that would be great but % uh
yah it 's no issue .
i mean three days i could-
we could still do everything that % uh you would like to do and
% uh i guess your friends the age one would be about twenty to thirty ?
yes .
% uh % hm , okay .
and % uh your budget will be in a range of a thousand dollars ?
% um i think % uh we would add-
would that be in singaporean or in peso-
in us dollars ?
i 'm not really very % um particular with the exchange rate yet
% uh but i-
% um individually i think our price range budget would be from thirty five to forty five thousand each .
pesos , so i think that would be-
% uh singa~
the-
so-
okay , everything that i quoted here will be in the region of a thousand dollars
so that means three person will be three thousand singapore dollars ?
a thousand , % uh .
% oh three thousand , okay .
alright , yah .
is that correct ?
yes .
it 's correct , yah ?
yah .
okay , alright .
so % uh because right now-
okay , we'll-
first of all we will be doing all the things the local people do
because you are still young right ,
so you can take the subway to-
from the airport to your hotel .
% uh so what i will suggest is the subway is located
on the eastern part of singapore in the area called changi
and you can take the east-west line .
% uh % hm , that will be great .
yes .
% uh % huh , east-west line .
yah .
so % um from the airport to % uh-
if we take the subway we can see the % um city
the scenery of singapore already , right ?
yes .
and the-
just hold on , % uh-
okay .
okay , because i 'm opening up % uh the subway map for you .
okay .
okay , can you see the map now ?
the mrt map ?
% um i think % um it 's too small .
too small ?
yah .
i~
yah , it 's okay now .
i can see it .
it 's okay now ?
yes .
okay .
alright , can you see the number three .
number three ,
yes .
on your right hand side ?
yes i can see it .
okay .
that 's where changi airport is .
changi , % uh % hm .
% hm , that 's on the east .
east . % oh this is the eastern part of singapore , okay .
east . % oh this is the eastern part of singapore , okay .
yes , so you 'll see a few colours right ?
so the green line will be the east-west line .
so can you see number two on your left hand side ?
yah .
yes .
% oh it 's far .
it 's from the-
it 's it 's in the other part .
so that is west .
yah .
so i 'm just giving you the green line that is from the east to the west .
okay , and the red line will be the north .
north ?
the red one so that 's the north ?
yah .
okay .
yah , can you see like % uh woodlands that 's in the north , okay ?
come again ?
woodlands .
okay , can you see the top-
woodlands , yes .
i can see the woodlands .
% uh okay .
and then down will be number ten ,
can you see number ten ?
number ten , no .
right down .
right down .
southwest
% uh south -
towards the south , number ten .
number ten .
% um can you bring it down a little more .
yah , a little bit more .
% uh yah .
that 's the maximum ,
number ten ?
yes , i can see number ten already .
okay .
that-
that 's marina bay .
okay , that 's the north -
yes .
% uh north .
that 's the north-south line .
% uh % huh , north -
and then we have the purple line .
yah , purple line .
east-west line % uh sorry , north-east line .
east-
north-east .
yah .
and then the yellow line .
that 's the circle line .
that 's the ?
circle .
circle ?
circle , yeah .
% uh okay .
and % uh this is our latest line .
alright .
so this is the map of our subway .
so it 's fairly easy to get around % uh our % uh sub-
by using the subway
and you will save like quite a lot of money instead of taking the taxis .
and of course you can always do some sight-seeing while you 're taking the subway , right
because % uh away from the centre part of the-
of singapore the trains will be running above ground .
yes .
yes .
yah .
so you actually get to view % uh you know the-
some parts % uh of the island
% uh and you know if you feel like stopping you can always stop .
% oh okay .
% oh so % um this % um coloured square these are % um substation , right
that we can always stop if we wanted to ?
that 's where you ha~
yes , correct .
% um , great .
alright .
okay so i will close this map so you have an idea right ,
how the subway trains run .
okay .
yah so what i will suggest is % uh when you arrive singapore you can get a map of the subway trains
and it 's just like any other country in the world .
% uh let 's say you are from changi and you want to go to paya lebar .
can you see the junction of the yellow and green line ?
yes .
okay , so let say you 're going there .
so what you do is you go to the train station
and you will press paya lebar and the machine will tell you how much is the cost .
alright , so you just put in the singapore money accordingly .
so again i 'll suggest that you change some % uh singapore money at the airport .
there 's a money changer inside ,
before you come out , before you collect your bags there 's a money changer there .
paya lebar .
% uh okay .
okay .
okay .
and when you just come out from % uh the transit area from the airport
% uh there are also money changer just immediately outside the % uh % uh the airport area .
alright ?
% uh % hm , okay .
yes .
so you change some money first
in order for you to take the subway to get to your hotel , alright .
so try to get some smaller notes like two dollars and five dollars .
okay .
so if from changi airport % uh until paya lebar -
lebar .
yah , % uh how much would it cost in the subway train ?
okay , if you are taking the % um uh-
if you are using because you-
i think you will be spending a few days
so what you can do is you can a buy a % uh-
you can buy this % uh a tourist card .
% oh a tourist card , yah .
that 's the one you 're gon na use-
% um that card you will be using when you 're going to ride in the lrt , right
so that % uh you wo n't be buying-
% um purchasing tickets when going in and out of the train ?
yah .
yes .
correct .
because % uh our standard card ,
let 's say if the price is a dollar you have to put in two dollars
because there is a one dollar deposit
and when you leave the station you have to get back your deposit .
okay .
% oh i see .
so there 's a deposit when you ride the train okay .
yah , because of % uh the cards .
so you must remember to get back your deposit after you exit from the % uh the barrier , alright ?
so like i said since you 're spending a few days
you can buy the % uh the tourist card or you can buy this stored value card as well .
okay , yes .
% hm , okay .
yah .
yah .
so of course there is also % uh % uh a deposit that 's % uh given to the stored value card .
alright .
okay ?
okay .
yah , so because we also have like % uh different timing
let 's say % uh morning off-peak hours there are certain and it 's slightly cheaper .
so i think-
yah .
so only way to save to-
you save quite a lot travelling on the mrt .
so we call our subway the mrt .
okay , mrt .
just like here we call it also mrt .
% oh , okay .
yah so no issue % uh .
so every-
all the information are given in english % uh
so it 's no problem for you if you 're coming from philippines .
yah .
yes .
yes .
yes .
yah .
so and if you need any help just feel free to approach our station
% uh our customer service is open .
you know the mrt % uh train station there 's always % uh office ,
you know you can approach them for help .
yes .
okay , that 's great .
yah , that 's great .
so we have to buy these cards in mrt in the morning
so that they 're much cheaper .
so % um these cards they have different prices within the day ?
% uh no we just have the morning % uh off-peak hours
but the rest of the day is the same price .
yah .
% ah okay .
yah .
okay , so now once you let say from the hotel -
% uh do you have any hotel in mind that you want to stay ?
% um actually not yet .
so do you think you can suggest some where we could stay ?
% hm , alright .
there are quite a number of % uh hotels that you can stay % uh the-
i guess you do n't really mind like % uh budget hotels ?
yah , no , of course not .
yah .
okay , we have % uh in bencoolen .
okay , it~
bencoolen .
bencoolen , it 's near to city hall .
and since it 's near in the city hall so that i~
do you have also % um like % uh museums there near-
yes we do have .
% uh yah .
yah .
s~
yah .
so that is like % uh bencoolen hotel , bayview hotel ,
it 's just in city hall so it 's fairly convenient for you .
so what you do is you take the train ,
% uh of course you have to get off at expo -
% uh tanah merah and then you change to the next train to get down to the-
% uh you use back the green line , the east-west line , you alight at city hall .
% uh o~
yes .
yes .
and from there it 's just about seven to ten minutes ' walk to the hotel .
% oh okay .
that 's great .
so and-
okay , so around your hotel there are lot of things to do .
okay , you can try some % uh local food there as well .
yah we would like to do that .
yah .
% uh okay i 'm just opening up the bayview hotel .
alright .
it 's just % uh five minutes
i would say bras basah to dhoby ghaut station
okay , so you just-
even if you do n't want to change station you can actually do a short walk from the city .
short walk , % uh okay .
yah .
i think walking would be much better
because you know while walking we can look around to see the-
right .
% uh yah .
yah .
so % uh from the city hall it 's just about ten minutes i would say
to the hotel .
% um of course these are like i would say city hotel so the rooms are not that big .
yah .
but i guess you 'll be out of the whole day , right ?
yes , definitely .
yah .
so just go back and sleep , yah .
so okay , and out there we have very nice % uh % uh museum .
we have the % uh national museum .
so-
okay .
again it 's just walk , alright .
just across from your hotel you can spend easily , you know
two hours , i would say minimum one hour in the museum .
one hour in the museum .
so % um what can we expect to see in the museum ?
yeah .
alright , we have a gallery % uh the history of singapore .
% uh it 's at the back part which is also the newest part of the museum .
% uh you can do-
you get a good overview of singapore history from the early-
% uh % uh before raffles time right through % uh modern singapore .
so just to do that gallery you need minimum forty five minutes .
yes .
yes , that 's good .
yes .
so that 's forty five minutes for that single gallery alone ?
yah .
yah because it 's quite a big gallery
and it 's very % uh i would say it 's very well planned
so you will get a very good overview of singapore history .
that 's good , that 's very interesting .
yah , if you-
yah , and if you have time you can do-
we have living galleries % uh on the second level .
% uh we have like fashion , food .
yah so yah % uh-
i would say then you go to-
if you have time alright
our food gallery .
% uh well that will give you an introduction to some of our local food .
yah .
alright , so you can do that .
and if your other friends or yourself would like to do some art % uh pieces
we have a very good museum just across from the national museum
it 's called sam , s a m .
yes .
yes , that 's good .
s a , sam museum ?
yes sam .
yah , it's-
we do n't call it sa~
% uh yah you can call it sam .
% uh it 's actually in full it stands for the singapore arts museum .
sam .
% oh singapore arts museum .
yes , alright .
so you can tour another hour out there
okay and this museum used to be located in an old school called saint joseph institution .
yah .
so these are the museums that 's taken care of , alright .
and of course if you like some relaxation
they have % uh sauna and fitness centre .
yes yes .
alright , in the hotel itself so you can do that .
% oh , so they have that already in the hotel ?
yah , they have a sauna and a fitness centre .
okay .
alright ?
yes .
and again , you know if you do n't want to have breakfast in your hotel
just outside your hotel there is an air-conditioned food court .
so that 's where we can try , you know the authentic singaporean cuisine ?
yes , it 's air-conditioned so you have various kind of food
like % uh from chinese , malay , indian % uh even philippines food .
my % uh-
yah .
% oh really ?
yah .
yes .
that is all found in this food court .
you know if you miss % uh food there is one store there as well .
that 's great .
% oh yah .
yah .
so-
but of course you want to try some local food so i 'll guess that
definitely we 'll try % um local food .
and one of our local food that % uh a lot of the local likes to do in the morning
is we have what we called the kaya toast with coffee .
kaya toast ?
kaya toast , yah .
so % uh we have this bread with two % uh soft boiled % uh egg .
alright and % um at the bread we will put some kaya
which is made of egg , it 's like egg custard .
bread .
% oh egg custard .
% uh egg , yah and coconut .
so we call it kaya .
% oh , okay .
yah and-
yes you can have your coffee .
so that 's a very local breakfast .
that 's sounds delicious .
yes .
so that 's what the local people do for breakfast .
a lot of us-
for breakfast .
yah , eat like that .
and then you can go over to do your museums .
yah .
alright .
and i would definitely also recommend going to sentosa island .
sentosa island , yah .
so sound % uh-
so you saw the bayview hotel already on the screen ?
yes .
yes .
okay .
alright so we can go to sentosa .
sentosa .
it 's an island of the southern part of singapore .
southern part .
yah .
okay and then i think you like % uh swimming as well , right ?
yes of course .
okay .
so you can do like a morning % uh swim .
yes .
and since your friend like % uh adventure
we have the adventure park .
yah .
% oh you have also adventure park , that 's good .

yah .
and then we have the climbmax as well
it 's an aerial % uh obstacle .
okay , you saw that on the screen now ?
yes .
okay .
so that would be-
% oh this climbmax is this one with the ropes ?
yah .
% oh okay .
okay .
so i think your friend will enjoy all these .
see , you saw this ?
yes .
i think this-
it 's on the screen now .
yes .
yes .
so i think she will get to enjoy herself
% um and let say if you or some of your other friends are not interested
you can do-
so you can separate .
you can-
some of them wants to do the adventure go to the adventure
the rest were not so adventurous can do sunbathing
or just have a swim in our lagoon .
yes .
okay , so you can do the beaches .
do you-
so in their beaches also do you have % um like % um scuba ?
do you-
do they al also offer scuba diving like that % uh snorkelling ?
% uh n~
no , not in sentosa .
no .
but in other parts you have ?
yah .
yah .
% oh you also have a-
what 's this , this universal-
yes , we have % uh universal studio as well .
% oh really ?
that 's great .
yah .
yah this is-
you saw universal studio now on the screen ?
% oh yah , yes .
yes .
okay .
% uh so i will suggest like a whole day trip on sentosa .
in sentosa .
yah .
so like your friends want to go adventure park they can do that .
you will spend about one hour , one and a half hours to two hours .
then you go over to universal park .
% um yes .
alright .
so you can see-
% uh you can do this-
so you 'll probably spend about another half day on % uh universal park .
yes .
is this where this % um dolphin show is ?
yah .
% uh it 's not open yet the dolphin thing
% uh but the uni~
% uh right now if you want to see the dolphin show
it 's in another attraction but on sentosa itself .
alright , and that would be at the underwater world .
% oh underwater world .
so what you do in the underwater world you go inside ,
it 's located like % uh below the ground area .
and you can go on this travel later that takes you around the whole underwater tank .
so-
% oh that 's great .
and they also have a dolphin show out there .
% um , yah .
okay .
so okay you saw the universal now on this screen ?
yes .
yes .
yes .
yah .
so you can buy like a day pass .
% uh day pass ?
yeah .
so that 's like % uh what ?
okay .
it 's cost an adult sixty eight dollars a day .
% oh the ticket .
yah okay .
yah .
and that would be like % uh weekday .
okay .
yah , for weekend it will be about seventy two dollars .
just a few dollars more .
alright .
yes .
so % uh that 's universal studio ,
of course lots of things to do there , all the interesting ride
like % uh madagascar and they have this transformer ride
i think that 's thrilling as well .
yes .
okay .
yah .
so % uh % um we have to spend like % um the whole day in sentosa for that right ?
% uh i would say to four hours minimum .
four hours , okay .
yah .
because if you want to do some of the rides , you know and the show .
yes .
so that 's something you can do and let 's say in the evening -
% uh % huh , in the evening .
evening you can do % uh-
we have actually another show it 's called song of the sea .
so that 's like a play , right ?
% uh it 's a play .
% uh it 's water and laser and fire show .
% oh that 's good .
so-
yah .
% oh yah .
yah i 've seen one here also
that 's very beautiful by the way .
so you can do that you know
% uh and then maybe you can have a late dinner .
let 's say you see the show at seven thirty , seven forty and then you come out .
you take the % uh sentosa express
it 's a train on sentosa and you can have your dinner over at vivocity .
yah .
at ?
vivo .
vivocity , okay .
yah .
when you come out of the island it 's on the south , alright .
and it 's just about % uh one km away
there 's this big wave like shopping centre called vivocity .
% uh it's-
so it 's like a mall ?
yes , it 's a shopping mall there are lots of restaurants there .
okay and if you do n't like % uh you can go over to clarke quay .
okay .
clarke quay .
yah .
clarke , c l a r k e next word is q u a y .
% oh clarke quay , yah .
yah .
so again there are lot restaurants out there
% uh and you can have your meal by the singapore river .
% um that 's great .
yah and you can have drinks .
alright after your dinner you can have drinks there
it is a very popular % uh area for both singaporeans and tourists .
so i think it % uh-
the view there is much better at night than at day time ?
yes .
% uh of course it 's not as hot and % uh people come out to play so it 's nice .
but day time is also alright
because at day it will be a little bit quieter
% oh yah .
yah .
so there 's a lot of % uh people out in clarke quay .
at-
okay .
but it 's not that crowded as in you know it 's so crowded ,
i mean it 's just % uh nice crowd out there .
yes .
so it 's much-
it 's a place where we can relax after the day , right ?
yah , you can just go and
have drinks and
some of the restaurants are in fact in singapore we do n't dress up
i would say we dress down .
so it 's alright if we were just in our usual clothes
not really-
yes .
yah you do n't really need to % uh dress up .
% oh yah .
yah .
yah .
clarke quay .
alright .
so i 'm actually clipping for you the % uh clarke quay area .
clarke quay .
% oh that 's beautiful .
yah you saw ?
you saw the % uh-
yah you saw the restaurants by the bay .
okay .
so there are different % uh % uh restaurants out there .
okay there are so many outlets out there .
yah .
% oh so this-
there you can see now % uh the shape of clarke quay .
yah .
okay the blue part
can you see the blue part ?
blue part , yah
this is water ?
yah , that is the-
yes , that 's the singapore river .
% oh that 's the singapore-
okay .
so you can have your meals -
you see all these red , purple
all these are restaurants .
okay all these are restaurants here
block d , block e , block a , they are all restaurants out there .
% oh yah .
i think it 's nice to have a meal on one of that restaurants .
yah .
yah .
and of course you must always try our signature-
singapore signature 's food right ?
yes .
so what can you suggest that % um we should try ?
so we-
okay .
you can have our signature chili crab , pepper crab in the seafood restaurants .
yah so do try that and of course with some other dishes
% uh the other restaurant 's recommendation
but do n't forget to try our signature food .
yes definitely we 'll do that .
so % uh most of % um more-
% uh most of the singaporean cuisines are seafoods , right ?
yah .
% uh no , we have a lot of other food as well
it 's just that i think a lot of people % uh know about the % uh chili crabs and pepper crabs
because we-
% uh the local love this food very much .
% oh i see .
so that 's just-
and our-
and some of our other local food will be like % um % uh fried hokkien noodles
yah , noodles .
yah .
yah , prawn noodles .
yes .
% uh if you like % uh we have fried kway teow as well .
okay % uh otah , things like this okay .
but-
yah , okay .
yah , i think .
and april -
okay april we still do have-
have you ever tried the durian ?
the what ?
durian , the fruit .
no .
durian , yah
we also have that here in the southern part .
% uh okay .
do you like durian ?
yes .
not very much .
% ah okay , okay .
so yah .
so then i think % uh we will just % uh-
bu~
but you have that also , the durian ?
yah the local people like eat-
to eat this fruit very much .
the-
but it 's really-
it taste good but it 's just the smell .
it 's some kind of pungent .
yah .
alright , right .
okay .
so i think that 's fine .
i think you can just try our chili crabs and pepper crab
and it 's fine to eat with your hands .
yes .
yes .
we'll-
even if you are in a restaurant it 's fine
you can just use your hands to eat them .
yah .
really ?
yah .
so we eat with our hands in the restaurants .
yes .
% oh yes .
yah .
and all the restaurants if you order this dish
they always give you a bowl with water and lime or lemon in the water ,
that 's not for drinking it 's for you to wash your hands .
to wash the hands .
yah .
we might take it as a juice .
yah .
yah .
yah just to warn you first , you know that 's not for drinking .
yes , yah .
well yes , thank you for warning me .
yah .
so you can try-
you can do that as well .
and then the first day maybe do it , take it easier ,
you do a little bit of museum
do a bit of shopping around your hotel area .
yes .
yes .
yes .
yes .
% uh there 's a shopping mall called city hall .
near the city hall also ?
okay , that 's great .
yah , in city hall there is shopping centre called raffles city .
raffles city ?
raffles city .
raffle-
raffles .
raffles , r a f f l e s .
ra~
raffles .
% oh , raffles city .
yah .
so there all the shopping outlets there
including mid-range to local brands to % uh the luxury brands .
yes .
yah .
% uh and if you are still not tired
you can go over to the underground shopping mall called citylink .
yes .
% oh you have lower one also ?
yah .
it 's just from city hall .
i think-
% oh from city hall also .
it 's also near from city hall ?
okay .
yah .
yah .
it 's just % uh inside in the basement area .
% oh in the ba~
and from there you can walk to another shopping area called marina square .
marina square , % oh .
yah .
yes , so what can we-
% uh what can we expect to see the marina square ?
is it much cheaper in the raffles city ?
than raffles city ?
i would say some of them have different % uh outlets out there .
% uh and you can also from % uh your hotel area
you go over to our very famous shopping street called orchard road .
you take the mrt .
% oh okay , we take the mrt .
yah .
yah from dhoby ghaut or bras basah , okay .
% uh and you go to this shopping street called orchard road ,
it 's just about three stop away from your % uh hotel .
okay .
so every other building will be either a shopping mall or a hotel .
okay .
yah .
so you can do a bit of shopping and also you can have your meals out there .
yah .
so again all the shopping mall will have a food court .
okay so that they-
we wo n't go far more from % um the shopping mall .
so if we get tired we can already eat there , right ?
yes or you can have a coffee or tea
% uh in a café in orchard road .
orchard road .
yah .
orchard road .
okay , i 'm just clicking out % uh orchard road now .
okay .
okay , can you see % uh just a picture there on the right hand side ?
right hand side % um .
it 's just one straight road .
and-
% ah it 's just like a street then there are % uh ma~
% um stalls already there .
yes .
every other building on the street will be either a shopping mall or a hotel .
% oh i see .
yah .
so again you have luxury brand to % uh mid-range to local brands
and it 's also fun to just do people watching out there on orchard road .
so again you just can dress casual .
casual , % oh yes .
yeah .
yah , so-
so aside from % um shopping
% um what else can we do here in orchard road ?
% uh you can do like people watching , a bit of shopping ,
you can do your coffee , tea .
% uh spend about-
again yo~
again they all depends , right ?
how much shopping do you want to do
% uh let say about two hours .
okay then you do your % uh museum .
okay .
yah .
yah .
okay .
and i think maybe the first day you go for your chili crab
at clarke quay that would be better .
yah .
so for-
okay ?
yes .
yah .
so like first day a little bit of walking around
% uh and again if you want to do some % uh-
yah i think that would be cover some of your first day .
second day set off early-
early , alright ?
yes .
yah .
second -
yes .
yes .
and then you go for your breakfast
a little bit of swim your friend can do all the adventure thing .
yah .
so second % uh-
% um so % um will you suggest that % uh we do sentosa island on the second day ?
alright .
yah .
i will suggest that you do that on the second day .
% uh do a bit of % uh the swim , the adventure park ,
afternoon you can go for your % uh universal studio .
yah .
yes
it close at seven so you can stay till seven
and then come out have your dinner .
yes .
so you can try a different cuisine now .
% uh first day you can do your chili crab
second days , i think most filipino 's like spicy food right ?
yes .
yah .
so we have-
you can try some indian food , malay food .
indian , % oh .
you also have % uh indian-
you also have a lot of indian foods there ?
yes , we-
all our food court we have indian food .
of course there are also restaurants there .
so you can do-
because if you 're coming out by seven o'clock
then you can come out and have dinner at vivocity .
yes .
% um and i guess by then you will finish about nine thirty , ten o'clock
then you can proceed home-
% uh proceed back to the hotel .
yes .
yes .
alright .
and third day i would suggest that you go up to our-
one of our % uh residential area .
residential area .
yah , just take the subway .
and you go to an area which is not too far away
that is the north line .
north line .
yah .
you can go to this area called toa payoh

t e-
t a o ?
and next word will be payoh .

so what can we expect to see here ?
okay .
% uh you can visit our-
just walk around % uh-
okay , you just walk around .
it 's quite interesting because you 're right in the heart of our residential area .
% uh huh .
% uh so we can see % um how the day to day of an ordinary singaporean resident is ?
yes .
right ?
yes . so you take the subway again from this .
yes . so you take the subway again from this .
% um % hm subway .
yah .
and % uh you see how every day how we live .
yes , that would be interesting .
and-
yah .
and what you can do is we have a gallery
in this building in toa payoh called hdb gallery .
toa payoh .
hdb .
okay .
hdb gallery .
okay . can you see now on the screen ?
okay . can you see now on the screen ?
yes .
okay .
so it showcase , you can spend about twenty minutes in there
just to have an idea of how our public housing is like .
% um % hm , okay .
% hm right from the early days in the nineteen sixties % uh to now .
so we can see % um how the singaporean housing have evolved through the years ?
yes
yes .
yes .
that 's great .
yah . so % uh that 's something you can do .
yah . so % uh that 's something you can do .
alright . so you just need-
alright . so you just need-
it 's a small gallery about twenty minutes is sufficient .
and then you can go to a local food centre
because there were a lot of little % uh food centres in toa payoh , alright ?
just go to the one that 's fairly crowded .
yah .
yes .
if you do n't know what to order ,
just look at what people are eating
and just ask them which store they order from .
yes .
yah .
we 'll do that .
alright ?
yah , so you 'll get to well % uh interact with our local
so it becomes a little bit more interesting .
yah .
and-
so you can do that for half day .
yes .
okay .
% uh and i guess afternoon you may want to do some spa ?
yah .
% uh yah .
or you can do your % uh-
again we do have spas around your hotel area ,
there are quite a few spas located there .
in all the shopping centre there 'll be a spa there .
yes .
so aside from the one at the hotel
% uh there are also lot of spas % um near the hotel ?
yah .
right .
okay .
yes .
there are also quite a few so you can do that
and i think that will cover your second day already .
yes .
okay .
and i would say the third day
you can visit the botanical gardens .
% oh botanical gardens .
that-
yah we 'll love to see that .
yah .
so that is located just off % uh orchard road .
orchard road , yah .
yah .
you can easily spend about two hours .
two hours .
okay you can see now the botanical gardens ?
% hm not yet .
% oh yes .
can you see now ?
okay .
yes .
alright , so-
% oh it 's beautiful .
so we got see % um different species of plants here that are endemic in singapore only
or do you have also plants from other countries ?
the plants is it ?
yes .
no we do have
but % uh actually the highlight of the botanical gardens would be % uh the orchids .
the ?
orchids .
okets ?
yes .
so what are the okets ?
orchids , the orchids plants ?
% uh o r c h i d s , orchids .
o ?
o r .
o r .
c h .
% oh orchids .
orchids , yes .
so that is actually % uh the highlight of this % uh garden .
% oh yah .
so-
see-
can you see national orchid garden ?
% um not yet .
also you have % um a lot-
different species of orchids here ?
yes .
% oh that's-
and it 's so beautiful out there .
yes .
alright ?
and they open early
as early as eight thirty in the morning to seven .
it 's % uh-
yes .
so admission for one adult is five dollars .
five dollars , yes .
yah .
% oh i think we 're gon na get a lot of pictures here .
yes
because every other spot is a picture spot .
yes .
okay .
so try to do that in the morning when it 's not so hot .
% uh % huh , yes .
yah .
and-
so aside from the orchids % um
are there any more plants that are showcased ?
like you know % um plants that are just % um endemic for-
in singapore like plants that are just found % um in singapore .
just in singapore , okay .
some of the orchids are cultivated here
% uh but of course we export our orchids .
in fact singapore is the world third
% uh largest exporter of orchids .
yah .
wow .
yes .
so we have like plants -
% uh orchids plants that are specially cultivated here .
% hm that 's great .
and we get to see that , yah .
yah .
yes .
yes , in the national orchid garden
in the singapore botanic gardens .
yah .
yes .
% oh that 's fun .
yah .
and if you are let 's say planning a trip there on a sunday
we normally have some free % uh shows in the garden
in the evening at six o'clock .
% oh shows .
yah .
so what do they do in these shows ?
it all depends
% uh we have it % uh once a month in the-
just outside the national orchid garden there is like a slope .
% uh so it depends .
it can be a jazz concert , it can be % uh % uh quintet , it can be singing , alright .
yah .
so it all depends on what is available ,
what is % uh planned for that particular sunday .
and you can always pack your picnic basket with wine
and just sit and with your mat , alright .
just sleep or sit over there .
yes .
yes .
i think-
yes .
so that would be the evening time already .
yes .
and then ?
so-
okay then sa~
let 's say if you are doing the morning garden , alright ?
then you can have your lunch again , you know anywhere you like either in orchard road
and you can plan a trip to chinatown .
yes .
% oh you have also chinatown there .
yes
because % uh you know traditionally we do have ethnic area in singapore
so we have like % uh chinatown , little india and kampong glam .
yes .
chinatown .
yah .
so again you can take the subway to go there .
subway again ?
yes .
so-
and then we just-
% um from the subway we just % um walk to chinatown ?
yes .
% uh it 's actually we have a station called chinatown station .
i~
okay .
otherwise the closest east-west line would be the tanjong pagar .
and you can walk about ten minutes ' walk .
you can visit-
ten minutes ' walk .
yah .
or you can visit one of our oldest chinese temple called th~
% oh really ?
yah , called thian hock keng temple .
yah .
so that 's a buddhist temple , right ?
% uh yes
it 's a buddhist , taoist and confucianism .
taoist .
okay .
so can you see now the picture of chinatown ?
% hm not yet .
okay .
% oh yah , i can see it now .
yah .
okay , chinatown .
% oh so-
alright , yah .
yah , so you can see this cup of coffee just now ?
% uh % hm , yes .
okay , the first china town .
so the-
so there are % um-
we can see % um-
% um we can go shopping here also and dine ?
so this is an old building , right ?
yah , these are all old building which has been restored .
so in the old days where the people from all over the world when they came to singapore
they like to live in this area which is near the singapore river .
% um and eventually it gets very crowded so people move away from this area
and it became just the chinese area .
people ca~
% uh a lot of chinese live here
because they work-
so only the chinese were left in this area
that 's why it 's called chinatown now ?
% uh i would say there are minority races who live here
but majority who were left here were the chinese , they live here .
% oh yes .
right .
so in the old days they live on the second floor or third floor ,
ground floor was used a shop
but today we used the ground floor as shops .
second and third level
% uh we mainly used them as either a store room or % uh office .
so it 's quite nice to walk around .
yes .
yes .
i noticed that % um the buildings they have % um huge windows ?
yes .
% oh , yes .
okay this-
because in the past there were no air-condition
% uh so they-
the architects i would say are pretty % uh creative , right ?
they make the big windows which is actually-
well we learned from % uh the europeans , alright ,
% uh to have big windows .
yes .
yes .
% oh so-
so these big windows are european influences , right ?
yah , they are influences % uh from europe
and when-
you see in the past when you open up fully
you can get more ventilation into the house .
and right in the centre there 's actually an air well .
yes .
air well .
yah .
air well that means it 's an open space
that goes up to the top of the building and it 's not covered .
yes .
so that 's like the ventilation so that-
% uh the ventilation of the air so that it 's too hot inside .
because-
correct , yah .
so % uh % uh the front is narrow but it 's pretty long
so they need to have some ventilation as well as light coming into the house .
% uh so these are the china town houses .
and if you go to china town
do look out for this green colour roof that looks like bamboo .
% oh yes , green colour .
yah .
yah
because % uh according to the chinese the bamboos represents % uh long life .
% oh really ?
bamboos they represent-
yeah .
so this-
yah .
so these are the % uh peculiar % uh features of the chinatown houses .
and also do look out for outside the houses
there are engravings like phoenixes , flowers % uh on the outside of the houses .
so these-
but it 's just above the green roof on the first level
there are usually some engravings out there .
okay .
yah .
so it 's nice to walk around .
you can go for foot massage over in chinatown .
you can have a chinese tea appreciation in chinatown as well .
okay .
so do spend about one hour if you plan to have your chinese tea appreciation
with some % uh so-called small bites you know like titbits kind of % uh thing .
alright .
yeah .
so there are few like % uh chinese tea appreciation % uh places
in chinatown itself .
so they also have that like % um-
do they also perform like % um tea ceremony like that ?
a tea what ?
a tea ceremony .
just like , you know in japan , right ?
they have tea ceremonies .
% oh okay .
okay .
our tea appreciation is not as elaborate as the japanese
% uh but our tea
if you are going to have your tea in the chinese % uh tea houses
the tea comes in-
they are being served in small little cups .
so % uh the owners or the server would be able to assist you
as to how we drink or appreciate this chinese tea .
appreciate , yes .
yah because you have to go a few rounds .
the first round is to warm up the cups
% uh then the first cup where you take is % uh for you to smell the tea
and later on you drink this tea .
so you sip , you do n't drink the whole cup .
it 's all very little cups , you know
it 's like % uh what the cups would look like the kind of % uh toys when we are small
we used to play with this little cups , it looks that small .
yes .
yes .
okay .
so they-
the cups used are just very small ?
yah it is a small cup
so it 's actually appreciation .
so you smell it first and then you sip slowly
and meanwhile , you know you sort of % uh chit chat with your friends .
so it 's very relaxing % uh in this kind of tea houses .
yes .
okay .
and of course at the same time you can order some small % uh % uh bites alright
but of course it will be more chinese related kind of % uh food like snacks .
yah , okay .
so i think % um that would be the last itinerary , right ?
yes .
and of course if you can go to the airport early
you can always do shopping out in the airport , your last minute shopping
because there 's so many shops in the airport even in the transit area .
yes .
yes .
okay .

but at the same time , we want something % um which is a bit historical
wherein we can learn something about your culture , your traits
and you know , different places wherein we can remember singapore at all times .
okay .
alright .
okay , so you want to do something historical and % uh this is your first time in singapore ?
yah .
okay .
alright .
% uh what we can do is-
one or two days .
alright now % uh you will arrive in changi airport .
alright .
and you can take the subway .
okay .
we call ours mrt and i think in philippines , you call it the same as well .
yah .
% eh , okay .
% uh all the signs , the street signs will all be written in english .
so you will have no problem % uh getting on the subway
or travelling around singapore either by bus or the subway .
okay , great .
yah .
so the subway station and changi airport is called changi airport .
alright .
and you will take the east west line .
east west line , okay .
it 's the green line .
okay .
% uh if it 's like a one day , you can buy a standard ticket
but if it 's for two days , you can % uh either buy a standard ticket
or you can buy the tourist ticket .
okay , is there any price difference between those tickets .
oh okay , it 's just that the standard % uh-
the stored value ticket will be easier for you to travel around
but there 's actually a five dollars % uh deposit .
okay .
% uh standard ticket , let 's say assuming if the price is like a dollar , you have to prepare two dollars .
at the end of your trip , you just remember to go back to the machine
and you 'll be able to get the % uh refund of that one dollar .
okay , that 's great .
yah .
so i 'll just show you in brief % uh the map .
alright .
i-
okay .
% uh of % uh of the subway train .
okay .
yah , can you see now ?
% hm no , not yet .
are you able to see now ?
no .
this is
okay .
alright , can you-
i think you should be able to see .
okay , so on the right-hand side where you see the number three
yah .
yes .
okay .
that is changi airport .
yah , the green line , right ?
yes , the green line .
okay .
you have to get off the train at expo .
okay .
and you will continue with the green line .
okay .
% uh and i guess the-
age-wise % uh you 're between twenty to thirties .
okay .
alright .
you can get off at-
there are few hotels that you can choose from .
okay .
okay , that is % uh one of-
well , it 's quite a new hotel now called v hotel .
v as in victory ?
just a v ?
letter v ?
yah .
new hotel .
okay .
it 's at lavender mrt .
okay .
okay , so that 's one hotel that you can choose .
the next hotel will be at bugis .
bugis , okay .
the next station .
% uh that 's called landmark hotel .
landmark .
yah .
okay .
and then if you go to the yellow line , just follow the green line up-
okay .
the yellow line .
yah .
that 's another word called bras basah .
yah .
okay .
there 's another hotel there called the % uh % uh bayview hotel .
oh okay .
okay .
so these are all % uh budget range hotel .
but i will chose these view hotels because they are very convenient in terms of % uh walking .
okay .
to your-
the places of interest .
have you any idea which % um the three of them is the best one ?
% uh best-
for a couples .
best as in ?
% uh when it comes to % um services , facilities and everything .
alright .
okay .
% uh the three hotels , they do have % um breakfast , they have % uh fitness centre
and also they have swimming pool % uh and sauna as well .
alright .
so i would say that they are fairly % uh compatible .
compatible .
% uh but the one at lavender , that would be quite a new hotel because they have just opened recently .
oh okay .
alright .
yes .
okay .
but if you want to be like very near to the main shopping area walk to the museum -
yah .
then i would say that the one closer to bras basah would be better .
oh okay , that 's great .
so i think and % uh i 'll be choosing that one .
okay .
so % uh that would be the bayview hotel .
okay .
you just cross like the first day , you can do a museum tour .
okay .
okay , just cross across from the hotel and you are at the national % uh museum of singapore .
oh cool .
so i just need to walk .
alright .
yes , you just need to walk .
okay .
alright .
so what you do is you just walk
you can spend easily .
alright , few hours in the museum .
% uh but i would say a minimum stay of one hour to two hours .
okay , cool .
yah .
so you go in to the newest part of the museum .
yah .
and-
alright % um okay .
this is our museum area .
you can see on the left-hand side , this glass area .
yah .
okay .
you go in from the older part of the museum , you go into the newer part of the museum .
but inside this gallery-
okay .
inside this gallery itself , you 'll be able to learn about the history of singapore right through
from the early nine hundreds to modern day singapore .
oh okay .
cool , yah .
% hm you can use the audio guide .
we have-
we do provide audio guides for you .
so do remember to % uh check out the audio guides .
alright .
so it 's self-explanatory .
and you can do like % uh a one hour inside this history gallery .
oh okay .
% um are all things there written in english too or any translation ?
were in-
yes , it 's in english .
% uh okay .
yes , in english .
so you can do this % um % uh tour .
alright .
and if you have time , you go back to the older part of the museum .
we have living galleries in there .
but if you do n't have , then that 's fine .
just cover the history part .
yah .
okay .
okay .
now after this , so you can do this in the morning .
yah .
okay , have your lunch in our many hawker centre .
okay , there 's just one just outside your hotel area .
okay .
what do they serve ?
okay , they have various kinds of food .
like chinese food , indian food , malay food and we even have fish and chips out in our hawker centre .
oh cool .
now , one meal % uh will cost you with drinks in the range of eight singapore dollars .
okay .
so that means like if you have rice with three dishes
% uh and a drink .
yah , that 's approximately about eight dollars .
okay , i understand .
alright .
alright ?
yah .
then from there , you can take the mrt -
to % uh chinatown .
chinatown , okay .
what can i see in chinatown ?
yah .
okay , because you would have a good idea of the history of singapore .
generally people came here from all over the world
okay .
% uh because they were looking for jobs out here-
% uh huh .
in the early days .
% uh so the chinese came , the malays from nearby , the malay archipelago .
% uh the indians from southern part of india .
the arabs .
% uh okay .
and the europeans of course , they came and-
yes .
in the beginning , all of them live in this place called chinatown .
% uh okay .
so-
alright .
okay .
but eventually it gets crowded so the % uh they moved away from this area .
okay .
so the chinese stayed back in chinatown .
then the malays moved to this area called kampong glam .
okay .
and the indians moved to this area called little india .
% uh okay .
so they have different % uh separate places now .
yes , so what we have done is we have preserved all these ethnic areas .
yes , so you can actually do chinatown first in the afternoon .
that means you can also have your lunch % uh in chinatown .
there 's also a non-air conditioned food court % uh in chinatown itself .
okay .
okay .
so you alight at chinatown mrt train station .
okay .
% um there are some other cafes there as well if you want to do your cafes .
walk around chinatown .
okay , so appreciate the architecture .
pick up a bit of % uh souvenirs from chinatown area .
% uh okay .
if i 'm going there this % um end of march , can % uh will i ever see any festivities in chinatown ?
do they have any festival right now ?
okay .
okay % uh not in april .
we do have a big festival in chinatown .
that would be in % uh january period .
january .
yes .
but it 's okay , it 's still very % um % uh
a nice walk around chinatown
because the houses there are preserved .
alright , they are under conservation status .
so the front part of the buildings are all preserved already .
so-
okay .
% uh oh okay .
so there are really ancient % um architectural designs there .
okay .
yah .
there are-
yah % uh , i would say we also learnt from the europeans
oh okay .
because you will see big windows
which allows air to ventilate the whole area .
oh okay .
so that will be their means of ventilation for that house or for that particular building .
yah , because in the old days , their houses were not air conditioned .
alright .
so % uh you can actually see % uh % uh
okay , that 's another view of chinatown .
alright .
oh okay .
oh .
that 's cool .
yes .
so % uh you can visit this-
on the right-hand side , there 's a buddha relic hotel % uh temple .
oh yes .
it 's a chinese temple .
okay .
okay .
% uh right .
can you see chinatown visitor centre ?
you can pay a visit to this chinatown centre .
yes .
yah .
and again , if you like to really learn more about the people in chinatown , how-
what kind of conditions they were living in .
% uh just about two street away , there is a chinatown heritage centre .
% uh okay .
so you can visit there as well and to see how people-
in the past , they lived in this very cram condition in chinatown .
so like one house will be divided into various cubicles
and you can have easily % uh-
fifty people living in just one house on one level .
oh really ?
yes , so that 's something very % uh unique i would say .
% uh of course we do n't live like this anymore
but this was how the % uh poor people , the coolies , the labourers , the rickshaw riders
they used to live in chinatown .
% uh okay .
and-
alright .
yah .
but % uh what if i wanted to visit a buddha temple .
is it okay ?
is there any rule that i need to follow because i 'm not a buddhist .
yah , it 's no problem .
this buddha relic temple is open to the public .
% uh just make sure that you are % uh dressed properly .
like % uh no short skirt , no shorts .
% uh if you are wearing culotte just
you know , have it like % uh touching the knee , below the knee .
if you are wearing like t-shirt , try to be get % uh wear a t-shirt that has sleeve and you 'll be fine .
okay .
okay , that 's great .
okay .
% uh if you are-
if you should really want to wear short , it 's still fine .
because at the front of the buddha relic temple , they do provide scarfs for you to put on .
% uh but i would say dressing-wise as in any other place of worship
just % uh this would be % uh good enough .
alright .
okay .
thank you for that .
yah .
and just down the road % uh i think we can do that just % uh buddha relic temple .
but if you really want to see another chinese temple , then you have to walk
to the % uh temple called thian hock keng temple .
that 's about % uh fifteen minutes walk away from here .
okay .
yah .
so you can do this .
alright .
do a little bit of lunch .
a bit of souvenir shopping .
appreciate the architecture because the architecture here would be different from the ones in
kampong glam and little india .
oh okay , i see now .
% uh so do look up .
you know you-
i think you can see just above the flowers , there are this green coloured roof
% uh that looks like bamboo plants .
yah .
yah .
okay , so this is-
the architecture would be different from the houses in kampong glam and little india .
% uh okay .
% um is it because it 's made up of wood
and the one that we have in little india is made up of that-
is that a difference ?
% uh no .
the difference % uh-
it just looks like % uh bamboo plants , they are made of ceramic .
alright .
% uh and because the chinese-
according to the chinese , the bamboos represents % uh bamboo .
alright , look-
they look bamboo and according to the chinese , bamboo means everlasting or long life .
okay .
% uh okay .
i thought they are real bamboos .
yah .
no , this is % uh-
% uh no .
they are not real bamboos .
they are made of ceramic tiles .
% uh it 's just that they are made to look like bamboos .
% hm okay .
so the bamboos according to the chinese are auspicious % uh symbol .
okay .
okay , so you will don't-
you will not see this kind of roof over in kampong glam and little india .
% uh okay .
alright .
okay , so after your walk in chinatown , i could guess that would be about two p.m .
you can go over to % uh little india .
little india , okay .
yah .
so you take the subway train again that happens to be the correct line .
so you will alight at % uh little india .
yah .
okay .
and again , it 's very straightforward , the main road of little india is serangoon road .
serangoon , okay .
serangoon , i 'll spell it for you .
s e r-
a n g o o n .
yah .
serangoon ?
yes , serangoon .
is that correct ?
yes , correct .
okay .
okay , so it 's just one main street .
and out of this main street , you can go to the little streets .
so if you are lost , you just go back to the main street again .
okay , yah .
yah .
and then i 'll see the % uh subway train again ?
so-
yes , when you get up from the chinatown .
chinatown , same station , you take the same line and you alight at little india .
yah .
oh okay .
that 's great .
yah .
okay .
so you will alight at the station called little india .
when you come out of the station -
but just remember that most of our subway or rather all our subway train station have a few exit .
you just come out to the exit that is towards % uh little india % uh arcade .
okay , but % uh there would be a sign-
i mean-
a sign .
yah , with signage .
yes .
yes , signage or someone whom i can ask about it .
okay , i might get lost .
right .
in all-
yes .
in all our mrt train station , there 's always a station master .
so % uh you just approach % uh the station master and anyway the signs are all quite clear .
so just alight-
% uh i mean just come out from the right side of the mrt train station .
% uh huh .
okay , no problem .
thank you .
okay .
and then at the % uh-
so the main area will be what we call the little india arcade .
okay .
it 's not a games arcade .
it 's just so-called the little india arcade .
okay , then you can do a walk because it's-
the whole atmosphere is totally different from chinatown .
you will see quite a few flower garland shop .
% uh because the indians % uh like flowers because it represents the way of life .
yes .
and of course they use-
% uh they buy-
the indians buy them or rather the hindus % uh they buy them
and offer the flower garlands to % uh their gods when they go to visit the % uh temples .
% uh okay .
alright .
yes .
okay .
so-
yes , so you can-
you will see like flower garland shop .
you will see % um shops selling vegetables .
what was that again ?
i 'm sorry .
vegetables .
like a market but they are like stand alone shops .
% hm okay .
and they do n't have this in the chinatown , right ?
% uh they do have a market .
% uh if you go back to-
now i 'm still showing the chinatown .
yah .
i 'm still showing the chinatown visitor % uh complex .
just on the left hand side , there is a food centre .
in the basement of the food centre is a market .
oh okay .
okay , but % uh-
so it 's like a wet market .
a wet market , it means the floor is perpetually wet .
okay .
so they sell meat , vegetable , fruits , flowers , everything is sold there .
but that close at twelve p.m .
yah .
oh okay .
alright .
so % uh if you want to do a market , you can do that .
and then take a trip to little india .
okay .
so take a trip on the subway to little india .
now in little india , the houses are a little bit different .
like i mentioned , you will not see % uh houses with this green roof .
yes .
the houses in little india will be a little bit more simpler in design .
compared to the ones in chinatown .
okay .
yah .
yah .
and-
so % uh take a walk around % uh little india
and % uh soak in the atmosphere out there .
the sari shop .
very colourful sari shop .
and of course do try the indian pancake called % uh roti prata .
yah .
okay .
there 's also north indian food called chapati .
and do you have any idea how much it will cost % uh eat-
i will eat in little india .
your eating in little india , it 's not very expensive .
% uh about eighty cents for a piece of plain roti prata .
oh really .
yah .
and you can also have this bread called naan .
% uh huh .
or you can have chapati which is made from wheat flour .
yes .
okay .
okay .
alright .
so you can eat with your hands .
% uh okay .
if you eating this kind of food -
okay , nobody will give you funny looks .
okay .
alright .
and % uh of course if you want to buy some sari-
the cheapest one would be in the range that 's made of poster
would be in the range of singapore dollars , ten dollars .
okay .
and you can wear with % uh short % uh blouse .
yah .
alright .
okay , so this is % uh
if you can see on the map , can you see the word serangoon road on the right-hand side ?
serangoon road .
yes .
yah .
you can see % uh-
so that is the whole-
the main road of % uh little india .
okay .
then you can see all the little road that leads out from serangoon road .
yah .
okay .
so you will be doing % um-
can you see the word campbell lane ?
yup .
okay .
oh % uh there is this-
a lot of activities can be found over there .
you can do % uh henna painting on your hands .
okay .
% uh the
you know , when you first apply , it were-
it 's black in colour but it takes about half an hour to dry .
when it starts to crack , you will just scrape off .
leave this orange % uh a stain on your hands , it probably last you about seven days .
okay .
okay .
so the indians lady do the henna painting like right now for special occasions
when they get married
for special % uh festival but otherwise you can do henna painting any time .
okay .
and % um do they have these designs for me or i will be the one whose going to give them a design .
or i just need to choose a , you know , a typical design wherein they-
it 's like a tradition from them .
% uh no , they do have-
% uh traditionally of course it 's just % uh flowers or geometric design .
flowers mainly .
so they do have % uh patterns for you to choose .
% uh huh .
oh okay .
yah , the artist are pretty good .
they can just come out .
they can draw for you within like % uh
less than five minutes and they are done .
okay , that 's cool .
okay .
and you get about % uh-
okay , i just want to show you some of the scene-
in chinatown % uh in little india , this one here .
okay .
okay .
and the next one is food .
do you like colourful food ?
yup .
okay .
% uh one of the typical indian food is called indian rojak .
rojak .
rojak will be-
that means like everything mixed together .
so you can choose what you like % uh from potatoes to egg , to meat .
okay , it 's a combination of everything .
yes so you choose what you like .
% uh that they are usually quite colourful and they serve you in this orange looking % uh sauce .
and the next one will be the flower garland shop that i just talked about .
% uh okay .
are all this food spicy and-
okay .
you know % uh are all of them spicy ?
no , not really .
okay , like the % um % uh indian rojak for example .
% uh the sauce is not that spicy .
just a little bit spicy but if you do n't like spicy food , you can actually skip the sauce .
% uh okay .
% uh for the naan , of course it 's not spicy , it 's made of % uh wheat flour .
roti prata , they are all made of flour .
and if you again do n't like spicy food , then you skip the % uh curry .
well some of our younger children , they do eat roti prata with sugar but that 's not very traditional .
% uh huh .
oh okay .
yah .
or if you again don't-
you do n't like spicy food , is it ?
not really .
okay .
so you can also have your roti prata or your chapati with dhal .
okay , it 's a sauce called dhal .
it 's made from beans so it 's not spicy .
% uh okay .
so i just need to request this from the salesman ?
yes .
so instead of getting curry , you ask for dhal .
okay .
alright .
it 's dhal .
okay .
okay .
dhal , yah .
and % uh that 's also a typical food in little india .
yah , i think these are quite typical food already in little india .
okay , and you can have a drink -
called lassi , l a s s i .
okay , lassi .
it's-
it is taste a little bit like yogurt .
yogurt .
so is it-
taste a little bit like yogurt .
okay .
it 's made up of what ?
okay , but-
okay , it 's made up of yogurt .
alright .
% uh but they have added in like the modern % uh taste would be-
you can have mango lassi .
oh okay , so-
alright .
there are all the different kind of fruits % uh that 's added into this % uh yogurt drink .
okay , that 's very interesting .
so it 's a typical-
yah , it 's a typical indian drink .
okay , and i just need to choose what kind of fruit i wanted to % uh mix with this lassi .
right .
okay .
okay .
so a meal in % uh food centre would cost you about-
with the % uh lassi .
about eight dollars .
% hm okay , that 's cheap .
okay .
now , so you can walk around little india , i gave you a few images for you to see .
and then you can go on to do kampong glam .
kampong glam .
okay .
yah .
so remember earlier on i said about the different races that used to live in singapore
and later it was so crowded , they all moved away to different parts of singapore .
yah .
so if you 're really done your museum tour , that will be a good way to see % uh
you know , how the people you % uh live in these different areas .
% uh huh .
okay , so the people in little india , in the past they used to engage in cattle related activities .
okay .
like % uh milking of cows .
oh okay .
so again if you look at the map , there are roads named after buffalos .
right , there 's a buffalo road .
oh yah .
okay , there is-
if you walk-
look up a bit , it 's called-
there 's another road called kerbau road .
that 's also named after buffalos or cows .
oh okay .
that 's malay , but-
okay ?
so from our street names , you can actually tell what kind of activities , people in the past used to engage in .
okay , that 's great .
alright .
so you walk a little bit down serangoon road , you will come to this % uh sri veeramakaliamman temple .
yah .
so from there % uh
in the afternoon , the-
in the afternoon , the temple is closed but you still can get good photograph of the exterior part of the temple .
% uh % hm okay .
take some good pictures .
yah .
and then you just walk to farrer park , just walk straight .
again , you 'll come to the mrt called farrer park mrt .
yup .
and then take a train to kampong glam but you have to change train .
oh okay .
alright .
so % uh if you are not too tired .
alright .
so otherwise you can reserve kampong glam for the next day .
% uh okay , it's-
because you 'll be doing chinatown , little india in the first day .
so like some of the other souvenirs that you may want to pick up in little india would be like bangles .
you can buy bangles for a dollar each .
for a dollar of % uh
a dollar for a few of these plastic bangles .
okay .
sari if it 's not too elaborate about singapore dollars , ten dollars onwards .
% uh okay , it 's okay .
yah .
so some shop here they get your henna painting done .
yah , so that 's about five dollars .
% uh okay .
for one hand , yah .
okay .
okay .
so these are the things you want to do then you proceed on
either the same day or the next day you go to kampong glam .
if i wanted to go to kampong gam at the same day , is there any % um thing i can see at night .
okay , you try to reach the-
let 's say % uh-
it 's still very busy i would say in the night time
because there are lot of nice cafe out there .
okay .
so there is a night market ?
okay .
% uh , no night market in kampong glam but there are a lot of cafes
and of course the highlight would be the sultan mosque .
what would that be ?
okay .
okay , it 's a mosque so % uh again you have to be appropriately dressed-
okay .
for a visit to the mosque .
% uh but again if you want to visit the mosque , you try to time your timing let 's say before 4:30 .
okay .
alright .
so you can visit the mosque but just before the prayer hall .
% hm okay .
okay , so have a look , it 's a bit different from churches , you do n't see chairs inside the prayer hall .
% uh have a look , alright ?
and then just outside the mosque , there 's a street , it 's a walking-
a pedestrian mall called the bussorah mall .
okay .
alright .
some of the-
again like the architecture , take a look , it 's quite different from the little india as well as chinatown houses .
there are subtle differences .
this is the modern one ?
no , they are all traditional and conservation houses .
oh .
alright , so we have % uh seen little india , right ?
yah .
now , proceed to kampong glam .
okay .
because % um as i could see , they have % uh very % um different architectural designs .
oh , okay .
i would say subtle differences .
subtle differences .
okay , now yes .
you are actually seeing % um a white house , this used to be the sultan palace
but they are now undergoing % uh restoration .
okay .
alright .
so % uh glam is actually named after a tree by the name of the glam tree .
they used to grow abundantly around this area because they used to be % uh just next to the sea .
% hm so the boats , when they come here for trading , they stop there .
and these trees are pretty useful like if there 's a small leak on the boat
they can use % uh the bark of the tree to repair the small little hole .
% uh the leaves can be used to make medicine and the bark-
the fibres of the tree can be used to make baskets .
oh okay .
so this tree is very useful .
alright .
yah , we do n't get to see a lot of this tree but they are still available .
okay .
okay , so i 'll see-
i 'll show you now a map of % uh kampong glam .
okay , but you do n't need to do the whole thing .
you can just do the small part , alright .
okay .
it 's because it 's just-
if you have ony one hour , that 's still fine .
so you just walk around this certain street and i like to introduce you to-
if you remember the white building that i showed you , that 's % uh the sultan palace .
yes .
okay , just on outside , there 's a street called kandahar street .
okay .
okay .
% uh and this street has beautiful architecture .
oh okay .
okay .
so okay and just spend a bit of time ,
just outside the mosque , there 's a bussorah % uh mall .
you can pick up some traditional games and i think you have played them before possibly when you were young like five stone .
okay , yah .
% uh so some of these traditional games % uh you can pick them up .
the- it 's like about a dollar each for these kind of toys .
yes .
okay .
and then you can walk to % um % uh haji lane .
they are just one street away from each other .
% uh huh .
and you can have your dinner there .
so we have like mediterranean food .
so % uh i would say sorry % uh mid-eastern kind of % uh food .
% uh so you can just pick whichever cafes that you like .
okay , that 's great .
so i can have my dinner there .
yah .
yah , and then you can have drinks and you can even try this % uh shisha .
shisha .
it 's water pipes .
which are very popular in the arab countries .
yah .
yah .
so these are some interesting things that you want to do .
and of course if you want to try out belly dancing as well .
bel-
okay .
yah .
so you can also do that in kampong glam .
so there are belly dancers there ?
yah .
so you can just join them .
yah , you can watch their performance .
you can join them or you can even take a short course on belly dancing .
okay , that 's great .
okay .
so these are the things you want to do like either the whole day
or you can reserve next day for % uh kampong glam .
okay , no problem .
okay .
so i think % uh that 's about what you can do within one to two days , right ?
yes .
and of course do n't forget a little bit of % uh shopping or people watching in orchard road .
because you are just staying very near .
% uh just one to two station away from orchard road .
okay .
okay , and then of course we have the gst , the seven percent % uh tax rebate .
if you buy above a hundred dollars from the same shop .
oh okay , that 's great .
and which has this sign that says the gst .
gst .
like small little shops , they will not be gst % uh registered
so you wo n't get back your tax refund .
oh okay .
so i just need to go to store which is registered or i 'll and they are % um registered to the government ?
they offer gst ?
no , what you do is let 's say you are buying from a big shop , right ?
is that-
so % uh you just tell them you want a gst form , they will give it to you .
you just fill it up at the airport when you 're leaving singapore .
just make sure that you get it stamped .
% uh and-
when once you clear the immigration , you can get back your money-
oh .
in whatever currency you want .
okay , that 's wonderful .
so it 's only available with big shops , right ?
yah , the bigger shop that has this gst sign .
the small little shops , they will not be gst % uh registered
so they will not be able to % uh give you the gst form .
okay , i understand .
so % um-
okay .
can you also % uh help me if i wanted to % uh go to a place wherein i can relax ?
something like a beach .
do you have anything % um where that-
wherein i can just visit the seashore ?
near to % um my hotel ?
okay .
% uh what we can do is because we do n't have like fine sand in our % uh-
on the mainland .
okay .
% uh the nicer beach will be on sentosa island .
otherwise you-
if you do n't want , we have a beach that-
if you do n't have to go the sentosa island , then it will be on the east coast .
and % um it will take me about an hour or
how long do i need to travel from my % um hotel to get there ?
okay , you can take the % uh subway train .
yup .
% uh or you can take bus thirty six .
alright , to go to the east coast area .
yah .
% uh and just have a sunbathe and just relax or just have a little bit of swim .
% uh bring a picnic basket % uh to the east coast .
oh okay , that 's great .
so i can spend there the whole afternoon before i leave % uh singapore .
right .
and it 's also quite close to the airport .
oh really .
so i can just bring my things there before i leave .
yah .
yah but it maybe a bit troublesome , right ?
because you have to bring your luggage and all that there .
yah .
okay , so i suggest that if you still have time , you know
like the second day , just relax and then come back , pick up your luggage and then go to the airport .
% uh okay .
do they have the spas there ?
the what ?
the spa .
the spa in east coast -
% uh not in the east coast area , they do n't have the spa out there .
so our spa will be found mainly % uh in the shopping centre .
okay % uh yah .
and the hotels .
some of the hotels do offer spa .
oh okay .
alright .
sure .
no problem .
so i hope i had been helpful to you .
yah .
you had really gave me % um ideas what i , you know
when i get there , the things that i 'll do .
by the way , do you have months wherein you celebrate several festival ?
i wanted to see some , you know % um different-
sorry , you ?
if do you have % uh what kind of month do you have this % um celebration of festivals ?
% uh okay , we have the different % uh festivals that 's celebrated in singapore .
but % uh if you are coming in april
okay .
april , we do n't have a major festival .
in the month of april .
but-
oh okay .
but % um usually , you % uh what month do you celebrate your festivals ?
okay , we have % uh
depending on the year % uh chinese new year , usually january
where we have this major festival in chinatown .
% uh september would be the mooncake festival .
hari raya , some time in august .
and deepavali was be some time in october .
what would be the events for the % uh this mooncake festival .
the event would be-
you will see a lot of shops selling this cake that is round .
okay .
it looks like the moon .
okay , so this is celebrated by the chinese people .
% uh % hm okay .
it 's appreciation of the moon , i would say , this festival .
appreciation of the moons .
yah , there are of course legends associated with this mooncake festival .
okay , and % uh they also have this lantern festival ?
yes , it 's actually % uh mooncake and together it 's the lantern festival .
so we will eat mooncake , the children will carry lanterns .
% uh and just walk around where they live .
oh okay .
this happen for just a whole day or it happen for a week ?
do you have this celebration for a week ?
yah , we do have like in our housing estate , the children can actually walk around with a lantern
but otherwise it 's only for a particular day .
it should be somewhere in september .
oh okay .
how about-
yah , but-
yah , but anyway throughout this whole month , you 'll see a lot of shop selling this mooncake .
a lot of shops will be selling the lanterns % uh as well .
so you get this % uh mooncake % uh kind of festival mood throughout the whole month .
% hm okay .
yah .
so they have this parade as well ?
you know % uh i saw on tv that they have this % um parade of buddha .
is it the one % um-
yah ?
is it the one celebrated in the mooncake festival too ?
parade of buddha .
% uh no .
usually the mooncake % uh we just have mooncakes to eat and the children will carry
or even the adults carry lanterns % uh that 's about it for the lantern festival .
% uh okay .
okay .
yah .
alright .
okay % um could you also please % uh give me a bit description about this % uh
festival about the nine emperor gods .
okay , this is % uh not like a nationwide festival .
% uh oh .
okay , you know , the chinese have so many different gods .
so this is just a festival that is celebrated .
we have a temple in-
somewhere in the eastern part of singapore .
yah .
yah .
yah % uh so basically it 's one of these gods % uh % uh festival , that 's about it .
so the chinese will offer food and offering % uh to the gods .
oh okay .
so usually people just offer % uh foods to the gods .
food and offering .
yah , that 's right for the particular god 's birthday .
okay , that 's the only activity for this % uh day ?
% uh if you are going to the temples in the eastern part of singapore , then yes , they are-
it 's quite % uh festive .
you 'll see a lot of people offering prayers .
% uh otherwise it is not like a nationwide kind of % uh festival .
the major festival would be like chinese new year .
the chinese-
deepavali , hari raya and christmas eve .
that 's our major festival .
and-
chinese new year , if you are down in january feb- % uh january period .
% uh again very festival-like
because we have a lot more shop selling chinese new year cookies % uh decorations
so it 's a very kind of a festive mood .
oh okay .
% uh yah .
then hari raya would be again very festive but it will be either in kampong glam or another area called geylang .
again , people are selling food associated with the celebration of hari raya .
% uh people are buying new clothes .
% uh for the whole family to wear when they visit one another .
% uh deepavali , quite similar to the other two festivals .
and of course christmas time in december , we decorate all the buildings
along orchard road right up to the marina square .
yah .
oh okay .
so the major % um-
one of the major % uh festival that you have is % uh the chinese new year , right ?
i think % uh-
% uh chinese new year , hari raya , deepavali and christmas , that 's where everybody celebrate .
the-
this is where-
oh okay .
yah .
okay .
so % um september , we do n't really have a ma-
% uh sorry , april , we do n't really have a major festival but % uh good friday , it 's % uh our pub-
one of our public holidays here .
okay .
but % uh do you have any % um activities and any other activities % um
within the month of april like a summer day , you know
wherein i can enjoy anything under the sun .
summer day .
% uh we do n't have a summer day but because % uh
well , we are in the equator so it 's summer throughout the whole year .
% uh no major festival like i said in % uh april .
% hm okay .
so % uh
but otherwise it 's still busy .
alright , we are still busy and we still have a lot of tourist coming in throughout the whole year .
so you still get this very festival % uh mood in singapore .
oh okay , i think % uh-
yah .
i understand .
now , thank you so much .
yah .
okay , bye .
okay , have a great day , bye .
okay , bye .
hi , good afternoon .
hello .
hi % uh this is % uh tour guide one
% uh and my name is lynnette .
hello , i am participant number four
my name is lorena .
hi lorena .
hello .
hello .
% um i 'm planning to make a visit on singapore
and i 'm wondering if you can help me out to make my stay memorable .
okay sure ,
and % uh when do you plan to come to singapore ?
well actually i 'm planning to go there may-
on may twenty six , twenty seven .
okay , just for two days ?
yes two days .
and % uh would you be coming with any other people ?
yes .
i 'll be coming with my husband
because it 's his birthday and i 'm planning to give him a surprise .
okay .
yes
and i promised him to have a tour in singapore but that was % um like two years ago
and i think this is the right time that i can % um give that promise to him .
% hm okay .
so it 's a birthday treat .
yes .
alright .
is there-
and how many days were you be spending here ?
i think % um two to three days .
okay .
and is there anything in particular that your husband would like to see ?
% hm honestly nothing in particular
because % uh all we % uh just love to do is to shop , eat and
just travel and % um make sure to % uh see all the beautiful places in singapore . but-
just travel and % um make sure to % uh see all the beautiful places in singapore . but-
by the way % uh what 's the number one % um tourist place in singapore ?
number one ?
yes .
% uh right now i would say sentosa .
does he like to see % uh wildlife as well ?
% um yes , he will definitely love that .
but % um i 'm hearing a lot about sentosa .
% um i think that will be great if i 'll be able to visit there also .
% ah okay .
okay .
and does he like a little bit of relaxation or more adventure ?
% um i think we will love both
because we want to relax and
maybe on the first day we can % um have some adventures
like % um what you have told me to % uh visit wildlife and other stuffs
but i also love to have relaxation maybe on the second day or the third day .
right , okay .
so % uh what you can do is-
because just now you also mentioned to % uh look around singapore ?
yes .
so what i will suggest is % uh the first day you could do a little bit of sightseeing
and % uh also include either our zoo and night safari for first day
and second day sentosa .
% uh third day with a little bit of shopping % um and relaxation .
how does that sound to you ?
that sounds great .
% um by the way % um i have % uh one thousand singaporean dollars % um budget for the tour .
will that be % uh sufficient for the two of us or we need to % uh have additional budget ?
okay .
% uh i think it 's quite fine with a thousand dollars
it 's actually quite fine .
okay .
you can actually make do with that % uh in singapore .
and % uh coming in from the airport % uh
do you have any % uh hotel in mind ?
none .
not at all ?
yes not at all .
we 're still % um-
if you can suggest some hotel that we can stay
that will be very helpful for us .
right .
okay % uh there are quite a number of places that you can stay
% uh and it 's quite easy to get around using the subway trains
we call it the mrt out here .
% ah okay .
so that is-
% uh the mrt from changi is on the east ,
it is a green line .
okay .
and % um it is fairly easy .
% uh you buy a standard ticket .
so you just look for the place that you are % uh-
that the location that you will be alighting
and then the price will be flashed on the screen and you just pay accordingly .
so what i will suggest is % uh change some singapore money at the airport
either inside the transit hall or just outside after your collection of the bags
there are money changer there .
okay .
so you just change some small singapore money
like % uh a dollar coins , two dollars notes and five dollars note
to help-
just to % uh-
for your travelling needs on the subway
and to try out some local food .
okay .
% uh do you mean if i take-
if we took the subway it can take us to anywhere in singapore ?
yes almost anywhere in singapore .
almost anywhere .
yah .
so we have like % uh from changi airport is the east to the west line .
so if you take all the way you come to the west
that 's jurong .
then we have another line , the red colour line
that 's north to the south or south to the north line .
and then we have a purple line
% uh that goes from the % uh-
% uh that goes from the north-east line .
that 's the purple line ?
yes .
okay .
and % um how about-
so you told me that if i took the east line
it will take me all the way to the west , right ?
right .
okay .
so if i already reach west line
so you mean there 's another % uh place there where i can go to north line ?
% uh no .
% uh can you see the map now on the % uh internet ?
% um not yet .
can you please show me a map ?
okay , just give me a minute .
okay , no problem .
right , okay .
i think you should get it very soon in the next few seconds .
okay i 'm seeing it now .
okay , can you see number three on your right hand side ?
number three , % oh yes .
okay .
and the ne~ % uh-
you move to the left you see expo ?
yes .
alright .
so you have to change your train from here .
okay .
right .
and % uh-
so you have to change your train at tanah merah .
okay .
yah from tanah merah you follow the green line all the way down .
yes , i 'm seeing it .
okay .
and can you see a crossing between the red and the green line ?
yes that 's the city hall .
right .
that 's city hall , yah .
so that is actually one of the terminal station ,
% uh you can change line from here .
yes .
% oh now i understand .
so there are some point where i can make a stop
if i desire to change lines .
okay .
now-
yah .
yes .
yes .
and actually if you go back to tanah merah
you go to the left you will see paya lebar .
yes .
okay .
that is also another line that you can change ,
it 's to the yellow line
or if you move up a little bit to the purple line .
can you see the crisscross between yellow and green ?
yes , that 's the paya lebar .
yah , and then you-
yes .
and then you move up you will be able to see serangoon
across between yellow and purple .
yes .
yes .
yes .
so this are like-
once you see an intersection % uh with these two round circle ,
these are % uh stations that you can change line .
% oh thank you for that information .
okay .
and if you are moving from changi that 's to the-
you 're in the east .
so let 's say you 're going to take somewhere to bugis
if you move to the left .
yes .
alright .
% uh then you just go to the direction to bugis .
okay .
so if i want to go wildlife on my first day
how can i get there ?
yah .
yes .
alright .
okay now can you look to the red line ?
can you find the red line towards the north ?
yes .
yes .
okay .
can you find-
% uh there 's a intercross-
intersection between the red and yellow ?
marymount ?
yes .
lorong chuan .
then you move up-
yes , you move up a little bit to ang mo kio .
yes .
% oh so it 's in ang mo kio ?
% uh it 's not in ang mo kio
from there you have to change a bus
to go to the zoo and night safari .
and how much will that cost me ?
the ticket for entrance in night safari ?
okay , let me-
okay , you are just going to the night safari park , right ?
yes .
okay , let me just show you-
alright , can you see now ?
not yet ,
it-
i think it 's still loading in my end .
there .
alright , you got it ?
yes .
just a minute
it 's still loading .
okay .
it 's up now .
it 's up now , % uh .
okay .
alright .
the night safari park opens from seven thirty to twelve midnight .
okay .
and the admission cost is thirty two dollars for an adult .
that's-
looks interesting .
yes .
so basically you will be doing a tram ride .
and on the tram ride you will be able to see more than seventy per cent of the-
what the night safari has to offer
and there are a few walking tours that you can do on the night safari park .
but most of the time we will be riding ?
% uh you 'll be riding as in , in the park you mean ?
yes , in the park .
yes , on the tram
because % uh the western loop of the night safari
you ca n't walk so you will have to-
i would suggest that you take % uh a tram ride midway .
can you see the leopard now ?
just now .
not yet ,
i 'm still on the elephant .
okay .
there is a stop at the % uh leopard % uh trail .
so you could get off the leopard trail , do a half an hour walk
and then come back to the same tram station
to board back the next tram ride
and that will bring you back to the entrance .
so this ride itself excluding the walk is about forty minutes .
okay .
forty minutes at-
% um all in all .
just on the tram , yah .
it 's a slow ride and you can see the animals very up-close .
for example-
really ?
yes , quite close .
are we allowed to touch the animals ?
% uh no
because they are wild animals .
they are not like % uh trained
so it 's just that they live in this protected park .
so please do not stretch out your hands or any part of your body .
thanks for the-
and aside from the night safari
what are other places that we can visit ?
because i think we will wait-
we will need to wait until seven thirty
before we will be able to make a tour there , right ?
so what are the other place that i can % uh travel maybe on the afternoon
on my first day ?
yes .
okay , in the-
alright .
in the afternoon you could either do % uh the zoo % uh as well
because they are all-
they are just located % uh next door to one another
and you are looking at different animals .
% ah so you mean the zoo is different from the night safari ?
yes , they are just next door to one another
so it 's totally different .
so you are seeing-
in the zoo you 'll be seeing more mammals
% uh like the orang-utan , the chimpanzee .
% uh for the night safari it will be more of the nocturnal creatures
like the % uh % uh tigers , the leopards
% uh basically animals that hunt in the night time .
okay .
okay .
yah .
so this is something that you may want to consider .
% uh otherwise on the first day
% uh you could also do a little bit of % uh sightseeing around singapore
% uh going to the ethnic areas of singapore .
yes , i think that will be great .
so you could do a little bit of the % uh chinatown area , alright .
% uh you could also do a little bit of the kampong glam and little india
in the morning the whole day , alright ?
then in the night you can take % uh all these % uh places that i 've mentioned
are accessible on the mrt
except that you may have to just to change trains
but like i mentioned it 's fairly easy to get around .
yes .
but do you also have bars or night % uh clubs in singapore ?
yah , we do have quite a lot of the % uh bars .
% uh so maybe the first day you could do that and % uh
if let 's say after your % uh night safari and you 're not too tired
you can bring your husband , yourself relax % uh-
i would like to recommend you the clarke quay area or boat quay area ,
that 's in the southern part of singapore .
and what we 'll be able to see there ?
okay .
basically there are a lot of bars there
so you could have a drink .
% uh and of course i 'd like to recommend you-
% um specially concocted in singapore
it 's called the singapore gin sling .
% uh that is something % uh one of our signature drink
that you can get in any of the bars .
% uh but of course if you like something very traditional
then it will be at the raffles hotel
the long bar over at the raffles hotel .
but what 's the-
that 's also on the southern part of singapore .
okay .
what 's the best drink that you have tried yourself ?
best drink .
% uh i would say other drinks other than liquor
some traditional drinks % uh bubble tea
where we can get from small bubble tea shops .
% uh the indian drink will be lassi
% uh the malay drinks would teh tarik .
% um how does bubble drink taste ?
is it sweet or sour ?
okay , norm~
normally it 's a tinge of sweetness .
so it 's tea % uh mixed with a lot of different kind of % uh fruits
but it is not % um-
it doesn't-
it 's not as thick as a smoothie .
okay .
% uh yah .
so these are the other drinks that we have % uh other than cocktail drinks or wine .
% hm , i think it-
i think the % uh the bubble tea is healthy
because it 's tea and fruits .
yes .
so you can get this bubble tea from a lot of counters
% uh and they are usually counters located in shopping % uh complex .
% uh you would be able to find one such store
otherwise in some of our food centres
you maybe a to~
me~
you may be able to find them as well .
% uh because you know here in our place
we have lots of convenient stores that you can see almost around
if you 're going to make a % uh stroll on the night or even day time .
it 's very easy to buy something % um everywhere .
do you also have lots of convenient stores in singapore ?
i guess we do have a lot of convenient stores .
% um the local chain would be like cheers , c h e e r s .
it 's a small convenient store .
okay otherwise % uh every other % uh let 's say front of some shopping centres
you will also find little cafés .
% uh are you talking about like to get snacks and drink ?
yes .
yes .
okay .
alright .
so yes , one of the local ones would be like cheers
% um and then we have like supermarket ,
there is always one in % uh the major shopping centres ,
there is always a supermarket .
so we have % uh the local chain would be ntuc , % uh cold storage , shop n save .
% uh these are the kind of % uh i would say supermarket
and you can always find one % uh of this supermarket in % uh the shopping centres .
so you can always get your drinks , your snacks
basically do even marketing .
and how about shopping malls ?
alright , lots of them .
% uh major shopping centres located at the orchard belt area .
% uh so orchard road it 's one straight road .
so again if you remember correctly
if you take the green line to the left and then to city hall
there 's a big shopping centre there called raffles city .
beneath the road there is citylink .
and if you take another few stops away
% uh that 's to orchard road mrt train station .
% uh on that same stretch of road
there are lots and lots of shopping centre .
is the orchard road the main city ?
well i would say that singapore is one city
but it is a place where a lot of the locals , the tourists go there
for people watching , % uh do a bit of shopping
as well as have tea , dinners , lunch .
it 's a place where you can do a lot of things out there .
% ah okay .
because i remember i have one friend
who had % um on-the-job training % um in singapore
% um because % um when she 's graduating here
% um her school send her to singapore and
i remember the word orchard .
because that 's the one where-
that she always mentioned to me when she came back
and she 's telling me stories about the places that she has been .
% um i 've been hearing the word orchard
that 's why i 'm asking .
right .
% ah okay .
it 's % um-
actually this street name is actually named after the street before we developed into orchard road
used to be a plantation , orchard plantation
that 's how this street gets its name .
% uh so like some of the major shopping centre would be
% um tangs studio , tangs ,
% uh ngee ann city which is a huge shopping complex .
ion , it 's % uh one of the latest addition
% uh nice shopping centre .
% uh just all across one another and next to one another .
okay then if you go further down the street
you have paragon , % uh plaza singapura , % um the centrepoint , okay % uh one three one
do you have like a map of that place
so that i can-
i have % um a look of the malls , shopping-
different shopping malls that are interconnected there ?
right .
okay .
let me-
yes , okay .
alright .
okay % uh i 'm actually giving you the map now .
thank you .
okay , can you see % uh this shopping centre on top is called ion ?
yes
okay , this is-
yah .
then you can see some of the street scene , okay .
and i will also give you the map now .
yes , i 'm seeing-
okay .
okay , i 'm giving you the map now .
alright .
yah .
so-
okay , this is one whole-
okay , can you see this yellow box thing somewhere around number ten ?
number fifteen , number twenty two .
yes correct .
number fifteen , number ten the square yellow thing .
yes .
what 's that ?
alright .
okay , this is like the beginning of orchard belt .
okay , this whole street .
so you see all the blue buildings
they are all % uh hotels or shopping complexes .
okay .
so you mean from this yellow square
until % uh the number forty two blue square ?
yah .
all the way that 's all orchard road ?
shopping .
yes correct .
so these are all shopping .
so all the blue buildings are either shops or-
i mean shopping mall or hotels .
% hm , until forty nine ?
right .
% oh that 's great .
forty-
yah , okay .
so you could actually spend the whole day there if you want to .
yes .
i guess so .
yah
so % uh the shopping hours in singapore
% uh starts at ten o'clock finish at-
ten a.m ?
ten a.m . and finish at nine thirty .
and do you have all the popular brands that i can shop
like % um do you have-
what are the popular % um brands that i can % um see in the shopping malls ?
because % uh-
well you have the-
yah .
yah .
because i 'm not sure if % uh the brands here are the same on the % um malls in singapore ,
so what are some of the popular brands of clothes and % um other stuffs that i can buy ?
alright .
% uh we have of course the luxury brands
% uh gucci , coach , prada .
they are located in most of these shopping centres
like number thirty , twenty two ion we have them .
and then you move on to twenty seven that is paragon , right .
so these are the major brands can be found here .
and of course twenty three as well .
okay .
okay and number twenty six , okay .
so these are the luxury brands that you can find
% uh usually on the first level .
% uh on the basement area and upper floors
% uh you can get the mid-range and some of our local brands .
% uh i think right now the local bags and shoe brand ,
we have a home grown brand called % uh charles and keith .
okay .
they are found in % uh number twenty two , that 's ion .
% uh number twenty six , okay .
% uh and also twenty three , alright ?
so these are-
and of course over in number forty seven
alright , that 's plaza singapura .
they are found in these shopping mall
so this is % um home % uh home grown
so i do n't think you have this brand in % uh philippines .
how about % um places where i can buy shoes and bags ?
yah .
the brand that i just mentioned , you can buy them .
% uh otherwise if you do n't like this brand
% uh or you do n't like-
you ca n't find any of the % uh correct patterns that you want ,
in all these shopping centres you 'll be able to find other % uh stores % uh selling shoes , bags .
so all these shopping centres will have
% uh things like shoes , bag , % uh sunglasses , % uh jewellery
okay , they can be found in all these shopping complexes .
wow that 's very nice to hear .
% um well aside from shopping
i 'm also interested to visit some of the government % um offices in singapore .
are we allowed-
i mean are tourist allowed to visit like government offices
or different % um places where i can see some of the % um government sites in your place ?
yah .
% uh what particular-
% uh which % uh particular government offices you would like to visit ?
like for example % um if i want to see how the city hall looks like in singapore
compared to our % uh city hall here in philippines
like post offices , all that stuffs .
are we allowed or-
alright .
okay .
the post offices % uh yes
because it 's a public area so you can just walk in to any of our post offices in singapore .
% uh the city hall right now is % uh not used as a city hall anymore
we are % uh refurbishing it .
so we 're renovating it and it 's going to become one of our art gallery .
% uh what i will suggest is if you want to pay a visit to our ura ,
that 's near to the chinatown area ,
it 's called urban renewal authority .
% uh they-
we do have a very good city gallery , a gallery
that you can see % um the whole map of singapore
as well as % uh the central part of singapore .
okay .
how about % um like a national museum ,
do you have one ?
yes we have a very good % uh national museum at the bras basah area .
so-
% uh that will showcase singapore from the beginning right up to % uh the present day .
okay .
so how the-
how singapore evolved from years % um from different eras , right ?
yes .
so % uh it showcase you % uh even before raffles ' arrival
% uh right through % uh to second world wa~
% uh and then raffles arrived , where do people live
you know we have kings before .
and we move on to the second world war period
from nineteen forty three to nineteen forty five
and to present day , alright .
% uh to col~
% uh to independence to merger we sing~
% uh sorry before our independence
nineteen sixty three to nineteen sixty five
we merged with % uh malaya to form the federation of malaysia .
and independence
how we struggle through % uh to-
in order to find-
to build homes for the people living here , jobs , to modern day .
% um , s~
so you mean-
so i will really be able to learn a lot about singapore in that place .
yes correct .
so % uh you 'll be able to % uh learn a lot about singapore
in fact % uh the whole history of singapore .
i think i will put that % um on my list ,
of places to visit .
yes .
so-
yah .
so when you are going to chinatown ,
so you can pay a visit there
okay , then you learn ab~
% uh sorry .
% uh the history of singapore you will learn from the
national history of singapore -
% uh national % uh museum of singapore
at the % uh bras basah area .
and after that you can do the ura gallery
% uh and the chinatown area together .
is it on same area ?
% uh the ura , urban redevelopment authority
it 's the same area as chinatown .
% uh okay .
the national museum will be closer to the supreme court .
because you mentioned that you wanted to do some singapore % uh % uh offices , right ?
sup~
yah .
% uh we wouldn't-
you can also sit-in one of the court sessions in the supreme court
if you are just % uh yourself and your husband .
so any of the courts that 's open for hearing
you can actually walk in % um even for a ten minutes if you just want to sit-in
and you can just give-
really ?
yes .
% uh so-
% uh you 've mentioned that % uh we are allowed to enter one of the courts .
yes .
% uh but % uh before you enter into the supreme court
you will have to go through security .
so just like how you will pass through % uh the immigration while coming in % uh or leaving singapore
the normal security % uh procedure
that means you have check-
we will have to check your bags % um
and you make sure that you do not carry any % uh sharp objects
and % uh there 's no-
strictly no photography inside the supreme court .
really ?
because it really delights me to know it because-
actually personally i want to have a tour
in one of the supreme courts % uh in singapore
because i used to do transcriptions in court proceedings .
and-
okay , that 's great .
yes % uh that 's why it delighted me when you mentioned that
i can also have a tour in the supreme court
because % um honestly i 'm very-
i 'm curious on how the persons that i used to transcribe
% um i mean i really want to see them in person , right ?
and % um-
but are we allowed to sit-in
in like for if there is an on-going trial
and are we allowed to sit-in on the proceeding ?
yes you are allowed to .
like i mentioned you just have to go through security
before you enter into the court -
% uh before you enter into the supreme court
the normal % uh procedure meaning like no sharp objects
and strictly no photography when you are inside the supreme court .
okay .
but only for a limited time .
% uh office hours i would say .
% uh okay .
yah .
aside from supreme courts % um
what are % uh the other government places that we can visit ?
okay .
% uh the supreme court ch~ sit-in one of the court proceedings .
% uh like i said if you do n't want to sit
you can sit-in for as long or as short as you want to .
okay .
and the ura would be % uh a good introduction to our city landscape .
okay .
yes .
like i said you can do it with-
together with chinatown .
supreme court you can do it together with the national library -
% uh sorry % uh national museum of singapore .
okay .
and the-
so you also have national libraries ?
% oh yes .
the library is also located near the % uh bras basah area .
so national library , national % uh museum , supreme court .
so that will be also around the national museum area ?
yes .
pretty nearby .
% ah okay .
yah .
so-
so i can also drop by ?
the library is a green building .
that means they have a lot of % uh green itianative-
% uh initiative that is % uh built into the whole library .
but we have a lot of other % uh community libraries
all found within the various estate in singapore .
okay .
so enough for the government places .
how about place for relaxation ?
what are the places that % uh i can have some memorable experiences there ?
okay .
right .
% uh we have % uh sungei buloh
which is on the northwest of singapore .
so you saw the supreme court , right on the screen ?
yes .
yah , that 's the picture of the supreme court .
so you can do another wildlife walk over at sungei buloh .
is that still on the east ?
% uh that is northwest .
northwest .
yah .
what can i see on that % um area ?
okay .
there are mangrove and % uh wetland wildlife
so a lot of birds .
can you saw a picture now of the sungei wetland ?
yes .
okay .
national park .
yah .
okay .
alright .
so this is % um what we have out at the % uh northwest of singapore .
and we do have a free wireless % uh trail .
okay , you can just % uh sort of % uh borrow the % uh % uh % uh webcam .
okay .
okay .
and another % uh
other walks that you can do
you climb % uh bukit timah hill as well .
do you have mountains ?
well % uh bukit timah is not a mountain it 's a hill .
we do n't have mountains in singapore unfortunately .
our tallest hill is bukit timah
but it has a lot of % uh flora and fauna .
and-
but how high is the hill ?
% uh it 's three hundred and eighty six % uh metres tall .
like % um how many how many floors of a building ?
how many floor ?
approximately about % uh sixty-
i would say i think in a region of about sixty to seventy storey .
approximately .
really ?
that 's a bit % um high sixty to seventy .
a bit high ?
% oh but you are not going to climb steps
it 's like % uh a slope going up the hill and % uh
well you can do it within-
you can climb from the bottom to the top of hill .
it is not % uh a too fast running up
just walking a brisk walk
you should be able to arrive in one hour .
but % um are there also transport available ?
% uh no you have to climb up .
% ah okay .
yah .
but you see a lot of interesting plants
% uh when you are up on the-
% uh along the way up to the hill .
okay .
how about % um hotels ?
what are the number one hotel that you can offer me ?
okay just % uh-
i think you should be able to see a portion of the road
climbing up to bukit timah .
okay you 've seen that ?
yes .
the visitor centre .
okay i 'll come back to the hotel .
okay now let-
nature reserve .
yes .
alright let 's go to the hotels in singapore % uh .
there are lots of different category of hotels
so again it depends on % uh what you 're looking at .
% uh there are budget hotels .
if you like to stay in orchard road ,
% uh since this is a birthday celebration % uh-
yes .
yah you can consider staying around orchard road .
so you mean there are several hotels in-
along orchard road ?
there are lots of-
yah there are lot of hotels on orchard road
so it all depends on your % uh price % uh category .
% uh starting from % uh-
just beginning of orchard road % uh at the junction of scotts road
we have like hyatt hotel , marriott hotel .
okay .
and you move on we have grand park hotel .
so again i 'm coming back to the stretch of orchard road % uh .
yes .
we have like % uh % uh york hotel
just beside the goodwood park hotel , elizabeth hotel .
okay so % uh these are all the various hotel that is located on % uh % uh orchard road .
and then if-
but-
yah .
okay .
% um do the hotels offer like one day stay so-
because i 'm thinking if it 's possible for us to stay on different hotels every day
so that we could have different experiences ?
yah % uh will that be fine ?
yes , that 's fine .
% uh they do have % uh
you can have a one night stay % uh in the various hotel
so normal check-in like two to three o'clock in the afternoon
% uh and the next day the check out time % uh
is around twelve o'clock % uh the next day .
yes .
okay .
because % um i want to have % um one-
a bit expensive stay like on the second day
if i 'm going to get a 3 day visit .
i 'm planning to make the second day a very special one
so if ever i 'm going to get % um a hotel that
will have like a jacuzzi and all those special % um things that we can enjoy .
so-
and like for the % uh third day on-
or the first and the third day we can get like a hotel
that we can basically make a stay
before going to the adventures that we want to do like in the wildlife
because basically we will not be able to stay the whole day , right
on the hotel .
so i 'm planning if we can get a % uh a hotel
that we can stay just for one day .
alright .
okay there are quite a number of hotels % uh what you mentioned .
% uh there is like % uh fullerton bay hotel ,
it 's like a five-star luxury hotel .
% uh the the-
and this building just now you mentioned about post office , right ?
it used to be % uh the first % uh central post office in singapore
but it 's now converted to % uh fullerton hotel .
so that 's one , it 's a five-star luxury .
% uh we have at city hall mrt fairmont hotel .
on sentosa itself since i think you may also visit sentosa
you could stay at the capella .
but these are-
like i mentioned these are % uh five-star luxury hotels .
okay .
five-star .
yah .
okay , or you could also stay at the marina bay sands .
% uh this is like % uh landmark building .
% uh it faces the marina bay so you get a good % uh view
and of course remember to ask for the bay view side of the hotel , okay .
% uh and around the bay you have other hotels like % um
the pan pacific , the mandarin oriental ,
these are all % uh nice hotel .
okay so lots and lots of hotels available if you just want something very special .
okay .
so it just depends on the on the place where we will stay , right ?
yes , and also % uh the budget % uh that you would like to spend
because % uh they range % uh from-
in the region of about singapore dollars
one night stay about four hundred plus .
yes , the budget .
on five-star hotels ?
yes , they are five-star hotel .
but on the % um normal hotels ,
how much basically is the price ?
okay .
if you are talking about % uh let 's say % uh a hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars ?
yes .
okay , we have some of these hotel .
there is one in the orchard belt
it 's called the hotel supreme ,
it 's near to the plaza singapura .
i 'm also seeing east village .
okay .
east village ?
yes .
okay that 's a bit far off .
on east coast .
yah , it 's a little bit far off .
% uh okay , maybe i can also recommend you this hotel
called % uh link hotel .
it 's in-
ling ?
link , l i n k .
% oh link .
link hotel .
% uh it is located in the residential area called tiong bahru
and you are about % uh just one mrt away from chinatown .
okay .
alright .
or % uh-
that 's a three-star hotel ,
we move down it 's oxford hotel .
it 's also a good location % uh but they do n't have facilities like the spa .
okay but you can stay there as well for one night
then you do your museums , your ethnic area
and then the next day you move to a nice hotel .
yes .
correct .
yah .
so that would be in the region of below two hundred dollars per night .
and-
yes .
so that will cost me like four hundred for-
if i 'm going to stay on my first and third day .
% uh yah ,
that 's right .
right-
and how about sentosa ?
okay .
sentosa of course the best-
% uh there 's a-
how-
what are the-
what are the things that i can see there ?
what you-
okay .
sentosa there are lots of things ,
there is the beach , alright .
so you can do your morning % uh swim in the beach , the lagoon .
then you can go to the universal theme park .
you can go by % uh cable car to sentosa
form % uh either mount faber or harbourfront .
can you see the map now of sentosa ?
% um it 's still loading .
okay .
okay .
% oh it 's like a theme park .
okay so you c~
it 's an island .
% uh okay sentosa ,
can you see a % uh a bridge ?
yes .
a broad wall ?
okay , can you see that ?
okay .
so it 's linked to the mainland ,
it 's an island off the southern part of singapore .
so it is one big playground .
it 's one big playground , alright .
now-
so we need-
is it where we can do karting ?
% uh sorry , what did you say ?
karting .
% oh karting , yes .
yes .
yah .
% uh we have what we call the luge .
what 's that ?
it 's a little bit similar ,
% uh you can ride on this vehicle .
is it a motor vehicle ?
yes , something like that .
% uh but there is % uh fixed routing that you have to do .
is it a two wheel motor or-
right .
yes , so you-
so it 's like a bicycle ?
% uh i would n't say it 's like a bicycle , you do n't ride you know .
you basically press on like % uh accelerator .
a little bit like % uh those bumper cars but it 's not built like a bumper car
it is more open .
okay .
let me see .
okay i will show you what the luge is like .
okay .
can you show me one ?
yah , % um-
it 's still loading .
yah .
do you mean i just need to have-
% uh i just need to pay on the entrance
or i need to pay on every rides that i want to % uh try ?
% uh no .
this one you will have to pay extra % uh-
okay there are different % uh admission prices .
so let 's say if you want to do % uh the two-
% uh the luge alright
% uh that 's eighteen dollars .
two luge that means two ride .
% uh now can you see this people doing a luge ?
yes .
yah .
so it 's a little bit like bumper car but it 's not so covered , right ?
that 's the skyride .
yes .
it looks very % uh enjoyable .
yah .
so it 's quite great fun % uh doing the luge .
the prices for just one luge and one skyride
will be twelve dollars and fifty cents per person .
okay .
yah .
so this is the extra % uh prices that you will have to pay
and then you can go over and do the % uh resort world like % uh the universal studio .
okay .

i 'm catherine .
how are you ?
okay , i 'm fine catherine .
% uh so i hope you 're feeling great as well .
yah i am .
so-
okay , so how may i help you ?
% um i 'm planning to % um go to singapore
this coming may .
and i really don't-
honestly i really do n't have any idea of what i 'm going to do
aside from shopping .
so % uh maybe you could help me % um with the % um-
my destinations and where i could % um see other places
like % um % uh zoos or malls .
'cause that are-
okay .
alright .
yes .
like % uh , yah .
so % um my-
i 'm planning to visit singapore probably
in may .
right .
so that 's going to be a three day and two nights to-
so that 's going to be on may three and then i 'll have to leave on may five .
alright .
okay , and you are coming with % uh-
how many people are you coming with ?
% um i 'm going with my sister and my nephew .
so it 's going to be the three of us .
right .
and your nephew is below twelve ?
yes , correct .
okay .
so % um well first of all we would have-
over here in singapore we speak-
a lot of us speak english .
our street signs are all in english .
so you do n't really have a problem with communications .
% oh , very good .
% um % hm , that's-
now , when you arrive in the changi airport ,
do get some singapore money first .
exchange some money first
with our money changer booth .
they are found both in the transit area
as well as just immediately after the-
% uh after you collect your bags and you exit from the airport .
there are money changers there .
okay .
just get some smalls notes like a dollar coin , two dollars notes , and five dollars
to enable you to travel on our mrt .
okay , so first thing i wan na know % um how is the weather going to be in may ?
is it fine like it wo n't gon na rain , right ?
yah .
is it summer ?
yes , it 's not really the raining season .
% oh that 's great .
% uh in s~
yah in singapore we have summer
the whole year round .
% oh really ?
that 's really nice .
yes , nice , warm weather .
and % uh-
well even if it rains is not a big issue
because you could always spend some time in the mall , have a cup of coffee .
by the time you finish your drinks ,
the rain would have stopped .
just-
okay .
sounds really great .
yah .
just the way i love it .
right .
okay .
so once you board the mrt , you just % uh look for the % uh machine ,
the ticket machine
and they would tell you how much money to put in .
% uh just take note there is a deposit of one dollar .
so when you exit from your destination ,
remember to take back your
% uh one dollar deposit .
% um is there any % um a card-like % um deposit
that you 'll have to use for the mrt or-
% uh sorry , i did n't get you .
% um do we get us a card like % um pass ?
is that-
% oh yes .
once you go to the ticket machine ,
% uh you press your destination , which particular station you want to go to
and the machine will tell you how much to pay
to that destination .
% uh you will receive a card that looks like a credit card ,
that size .
okay , once you get the card you proceed to the % um entrance to the station ,
just tap your card ,
you go inside ,
% uh and airport that line is the green line is the east-west line .
okay .
% hm alright .
okay .
so you will have to change train at the station ,
the second station called tanah merah .
tanah merah .
how do you spell tanah merah ?
yes .
t a n a h .
% hm okay .
tanah merah .
so i 'll take a note of it .
yah .
yes .
and then so-
% um if i 'm going to % um
because % uh i think % um i will like to stick on a budget . % um-
where can i stay ?
okay , there are quite of few options .
again it depends on % uh which particular area that you like to stay in .
% uh there are some % uh hotels which are fairly inexpensive
% uh along orchard road .
which is on our main shopping area .
there are % uh hotels that are located in another area .
if you look at the green line ,
% uh that's-
it 's somewhere if you look at number five which is on the south .
orchard ro~
correct .
right ?
% uh you move up a little bit
between four and five
% uh there is this area called tiong bahru .
% hm tiong bahru .
okay .
yah .
so there 's a hotel there as well called link hotel .
otherwise if you again follow the green line ,
you will come to % uh bugis , there 's also hotel there .
and if you move up a little bit that 's lavender .
okay , that 's % uh v hotel .
okay , you go down a little bit to the yellow line , bras basah
% uh there is also a hotel out there .
and you move up the red line to orchard road , orchard-
can you see orchard ?
yup .
okay .
% uh there is two other hotels there ,
york hotel , elizabeth hotel .
% uh they are i would say % um reasonable rates
and yet you are very % uh right in the heart of the city .
okay , % uh per night % uh in the range of % uh a hundred and sixty dollars
right up to two hundred dollars per room .
alright .
the % um-
per room ?
so % um i could rent a room with-
% um together with my sister and my nephew .
yah .
yes , you could .
% uh we can stay in one room , okay .
yes , and you probably would require an extra bed for your nephew .
great .
huh .
% uh so this is the hotel area that you are talking about .
of course you like to % uh spend a little bit more
then again there are other hotels that you may want to consider
along orchard road .
of course like international hotels we have hyatt hotel .
% uh down to grand park hotel .
it 's near to the somerset mrt .
in between somerset and % uh orchard road .
so basically % um along this % um % uh so i could see a map .
% um this is like an mrt map , right ?
% uh so i will just have to follow % um-
i will just have to rode % um mrt to get to another hotel , and then to another hotel .
is that correct ?
yes .
% uh yes .
unless you planning to change hotel every night .
otherwise , yah .
so you take the mrt for sightseeing % uh .
i 'm showing this % uh mrt map for you get a feel of the different
% uh lines that we have .
and just to show you the hotel location for the various
% uh hotels that i 'm recommending .
yah , so there are very conveniently located
because they are very near to the mrt
and-
it's-
the mrt is actually a very inexpensive way of travelling in singapore .
okay .
correct .
so that 's what i want to hear con~
the conveniency with the travel , yah .
okay , so % um if i wanted to like shop for
% um if i 'm going to stay for example in % um orchard
and then i would like to shop .
% um where would you % um suggest for me to go ? `
% um where would you % um suggest for me to go ? `
yes .
right .
right .
right .
right .
okay , we have a over in-
near the somerset mrt ,
there are a few shopping centre .
actually the whole stretch from orchard station right to dhoby ghaut
every other hotel or building
it 's either a hotel
or a shopping mall .
right .
so our shopping hours starts from ten a.m .
to nine thirty every day .
hum .
okay .
so~
yah .
so you can do lots of shopping options out there .
yah , so i can stretch-
i need to stretch my legs before i get to singapore .
so you sho~
yah , you have to do a little bit of % uh exercise
before you come and do your shopping out here .
okay ?
okay .
so this is the shopping area .
so there 's always a lot of % uh things to do out here .
if you are tired , just go in to any of the cafés ,
% um have a smoothie or cold drink , coffee , tea , alright ?
and carry on shopping .
yah .
okay .
alright ?
so i guess for your nephew ,
you may want to do some sightseeing % uh with him
as well , okay .
or your friend % uh , yah .
you could do a little bit of % uh sightseeing .
so let say you are staying somewhere on orchard road , alright ?
the hotel that i was talking about .
% uh in the range of two hundred dollars ,
you could take the subway and you alight at city hall .
correct .
okay .
ci~
where is that ?

and you will see this % uh lion
which is an icon of singapore .
% ah the merlion , right ?
yes .
okay , can you see now ?

% um five minutes ?
is that five minutes along-
five minutes from the city hall ?
okay , five minutes to the padang area , it 's a shady spot .
you can walk and then you will come to the merlion
okay .
so i would say about ten minutes .

it 's very famous .
yah .
and from there , you can go-
opposite is a % uh nice building .

and that is the fullerton hotel .
fullerton hotel .

% uh you will just use the underpass
to go across to the opposite side of the merlion ,
and you will board your train at the raffles place mrt .
underpa~
and from there you take the west line .
% um can you show me a map perhaps ?

okay .
% uh just at this corner here ,
there is actually a shop there .
so if you want to pick up some % uh souvenirs ,
like the merlion keychain and all that .
you know , you pick it up there then you board the mrt .
yah , souvenirs .
okay .
and you will go down to the cha~
% uh tanjong pagar .
tanjong pagar .
yah .
you alight at tanjong pagar
because i 'm going to introduce you to the chinatown area .
alright .
then-
yah , so i do understand you have % uh chinatown in philippines , right ?
yes , correct .
% hm but it is a little bit different from what we have here .
% uh and you may want to visit the oldest chinese temple in singapore .
yes .
ok~
they call the thian hock keng temple .
thian-
so when i go to the temple ,
do i need to bring anything ?
well , just be appropriately dressed
like % uh no short shorts .
% uh and try to put on like shirt or t-shirts with sleeves
okay .
% hm , alright .
yah .
so basically that 's all % uh that-
so they are particular basically with def~
how we dress .
yes .
so i 'm gon na show you the image of % uh thian hock keng temple there .
so , right .
it says that % uh right now we are doing some restoration work to the temple ,
but it 's one of our oldest chinese-
is our oldest chinese temple .
so % um with this % um temple , we can not go in
since going to be restorated , is that correct ?
and then we can take pictures outside or ?
yes , you ar~
yes , you are allowed to take pictures outside the chinese temple .
in fact the most beautiful part of the temple would be the roof ,
where you see a lot of dragons , right ?
the dragons out there .
the roof it looks like bamboo ,
because according to the chinese ,
the bamboos are a symbol of long life .
correct .
but they are not made by bamboo ,
they are made of tiles .
is % uh , yah .
it 's built like-
it looks like a bamboo , that 's all .
yes .
looks like-
so % uh you could still do % uh-
you could still go inside although the temple is undergoing restoration .
% uh just a feel % uh and a god % uh in this particular temple is dedicated to
the goddess of the sea call ma zhu po .
so you could have a look inside , this chinese temple .
and when you leave the temple ,
this picture shows you the main entrance of the temple ,
you turn to your right-hand side
okay , you walk about % uh four hundred metres
and you will come to a hawker centre .
okay .
can-
which centre , i 'm sorry ?
hawker .
hawker .
% uh yes .
h a w k e r it is a non-air-conditioned food centre .
and what do i do there ?
i really don't-
okay .
you can have a lunch .
% ah okay .
yah , you can have your lunch there .
because the price it 's very reasonable .
are these-
okay so-
% um so % uh do they have like a specialty in that % um restaurant ?
% uh it 's not a restaurant .
it 's all little shop which is about % uh a hundred metre kind of a shop ,
hundred square metre .
% uh and they sell a lot of different kind of food .
% uh so it 's variety of food , yah .
huh ?
yes , it 's a variety % uh ranging from
chinese food to % uh malay and you can eat to indian
and you can even get some western meals there as well .
alright ?
so % uh some of the local dishes ,
you may want to try it out ,
would be % um carrot cake .
alright .
% hm is tha~
okay .
is-
so-
yah .
it 's not the-
definitely .
it 's not what you think the carrot looks like .
i would like to try that .
% uh this is our version of carrot cake .
% uh it 's actually white radish .
it 's radish fried with % uh flour and egg .
and sometimes it looks a bit dark
because they have been cook with a % uh dark sauce .
dark soya sauce .
okay , now can you see the word-
the highlighted area ?
amoy street food centre .
that's-
% uh , yah .
so you see the red % um-
thian hock keng temple , if you look at ayer-
telok ayer street ?
% hm % oh there .
yap .
right ?
you are here , remember i said
when you leave the temple , you turn right .
so it 's about a four hundred metres walk .
okay , and you actually pass by the al-abrar mosque .
and then % uh-
the highlighted area again ,
that 's % um a mosque .
% uh it 's a place of worship for the muslim .
yap .
muslims .
yah .
but % uh % uh normally if you are non-muslims ,
we do n't encourage you to go in .
you stand outside , you could actually look inside .
% hm okay .
so and then you just turn to the left again ,
you come to the amoy street food centre .
yah , so just look around the food centre .
see what looks interesting .
they are always % uh photos of the food that each of this vendor % uh sell .
yah , and again do carry a bit of singapore money with you .
'cause they are like a few dollars each .
like % uh carrot cake would probably cost about
% uh two fifty , two dollars fifty cents to three dollars
for one plate .
% oh okay .
i will definitely-
% uh as-
definitely i would try that carrot cake .
yah .
so it 's actually-
yes it 's quite different from the % uh kind of a baked carrot cake
that we often , yah .
so this is the chinese version .
yah .
right ?
yes , yap .
and % uh of course there are lots of other delicious food .
so if you are not so % uh-
if you just want something a little bit light then ,
you could try our fish soup with noodles .
okay .
so that would cost you a meal there would cost you three dollars for a main dish ,
and a drink will be in the region of a cold drink
in a region of a dollar forty cents .
okay. ,
okay .
yah ?
so that 's taken care of .
and then you just walk .
can you see amoy street ?
yap .
correct , yup .
okay , there is a pathway , % uh a kind of steps
where you climb up .
it 's about two-story tall .
and then you arrive at ann siang hill .
ann siang hill .
ann siang hill in green , can you see that ?
corre~
yup , i can .
alright .
so % uh these are very nice houses out here .
% um interesting i would say
because some of the houses here has two doors .
the outer door which is smaller like a cowboy door .
okay .
yah and then they have a bigger door .
so these are own traditionally by the peranakan chinese .
that means the strait born chinese .
% hm alright .
yah so bit-
it 's a nice row of houses here .
okay .
and you walk down-
and % uh-
ann siang road again .
okay .
and you come to south bridge road .
okay .
right ?
okay .
and you walk against the traffic
okay .
and you cross .
from here you can see sri mariamman temple .
yah , so this is an indian temple .
so we are doing your tour in the morning .
% uh the sri mariamman temple will be open 'til twelve o'clock in the afternoon .
in the afternoon , they still keep the front gates opened .
but there will not be so much activities going on in the afternoon .
% hm so it 's much better to % um go there in the morning , i guess .
they wouldn't-
before twelve o'clock .
% um % hm , correct .
yes so you can do that .
% uh take a look and you have to remove your shoes before you go into the indian temple .
just put your shoes % uh in the shoe racks .
yah and do a short walk in the temple .
and when you 're out ,
you turn left to pagoda street .
pagoda street .
okay .
yah .
so again you will see a lot of the chinatown
% uh houses with this bamboo roof .
and you also mention you like to pick up some souvenirs .
correct .
yah so there are some chinese souvenirs that you may want to pick up .
okay .
% uh right .
so you can just walk around .
and there are some coffee shops ,
coffee shops meaning % uh non-air-conditioned drinking places and food place ~
right .
so anytime you are hungry or thirsty , you can always pick up some food or drinks
along the-
okay % uh-
along the way .
correct .
yah .
okay .
very convenient .
yes .
so you follow this road again down to trengganu street .
okay .
okay , so-
and you make a left turn .
okay .
you come to sago street .
okay .
right .
now on sago street , there are about two shops there that sells
% uh specifically chinese pastry .
chinese pastry .
yah , that you may not see in the normal % uh kind of bakery .
so there are all sorts of chinese pastry there .
okay .
alright .
so % uh and if you again want to visit another chinese temple
there is another chinese temple % uh called the buddha relic temple .
it 's just in-between sago street and sago lane .
okay .
so % um let 's say if i wanted to % um go to a park or a zoo for my nephew ,
so where can i go ?
right .
% uh i would recommend the morning or afternoon zoo for you .
okay , so that like you can do like a half day ,
% uh almost full day already , right ?
because you were walking from the merlion right up to the chinatown .
and i guess with all this walk ,
you would be a little bit tired .
correct .
so in the night time , you may just want to % uh rest up for-
% uh rest for a little while
before you head out for dinner .
okay .
% uh we will come back to the dinner places later on .
let 's go to the zoo .
okay .
so % um where is this zoo located ?
okay , the zoo is located in the % uh north part of singapore .
it-
north part .
so % uh-
% um how do i get there ?
do i rode the train or how 's the mode of transportation to % um-
going to the zoo from % um let say orchard road .
okay , we do have the zoo express % uh that you can take .
% uh as you can see there are different timings and % uh different % uh places of % uh pick-up .
so-
otherwise , you can take the subway , the mrt ,
to ang mo kio .
and from there you board a bus to the zoo .
% oh okay so it 's a night safari ?
% ah okay .
this is the morning and afternoon zoo .
% uh if he-
if your nephew like the different-
% uh the animals , you can do combine both together .
so i would suggest if you want to do two attractions ,
you can do in the afternoon ,
% uh and dinner out in the zoo or night safari park .
there are food and beverages and fast food available in both the % um zoo and the night safari park .
right .
so % uh in the day zoo this will be more % uh mammals that you see in the day zoo .
% uh you can also do-
% uh there 's also a tram ride that you can take ,
and then % uh in the middle of the zoo , you can alight and walk around ,
do a little bit of the % uh attractions .
and then you board back the tram .
alright , same thing with the night safari .
the night safari , you were going to see different animals .
the night safari will be % uh ninety per cent-
% uh it 's , yah .
ninety per cent will be nocturnal creatures ,
% uh like the leopards , the tigers which are nocturnal creatures .
% um they are encaged ?
no , our zoo -
both our zoo and night safari so they are called open zoo .
so you wo n't see cages .
% uh they are thro~
they are put in % uh as close as possible to what they would live in the wild .
yah , but not to worry .
they do not come out of their so-called enclosure .
okay .
% hm so it 's really-
now i can breathe .
yah .
it 's beautiful , it 's like park , you know .
is-
i 'm showing you now % uh just portion of the day zoo .
and let 's go to the night safari park .
okay .
okay , this is our night safari park .
yes , so you can see the first picture ?
these are wild malayan tapir .
so you 'll be getting on this tram .
% uh it 's a open tram , alright .
% uh and these animals are wild creatures ,
so do not stretch out any part of your body .
alright , and do not touch the animals ,
they are wild animals .
the leopards % uh they are separated from you
by the glass enclosure .
% hm alright .
are we allowed to feed them ?
% uh no feeding because they are wild animals .
and the zoo and the night safari have a standard
% uh feeding time for the animals .
so we do n't want them to get overweight , right ?
okay .
alright .
correct .
okay .
so this is % uh-
it will be very interesting .
you get on the tram ride and in the middle
% uh there is a stop called the leopard 's trail ,
you get off the tram , do a half an hour walk ,
to see the animals .
come back and take the next tram
and you are back at the entrance .
so on the tram ride it 's about forty minutes excluding the walk .
% uh and at the e~
main entrance , there is another walking trail called the fishing cat trail .
correct .
% hm okay .
so this is the % uh night safari .
okay .
there are like shows if your nephew is interested ,
we have the creatures of the night show .
he would definitely like that .
this-
yah .
so what the safari do is they bring up some of the animals ,
the smaller animals ,
and % uh-
it 's just a-
it 's a simple show % uh to show you how basically animals behave .
that 's about it .
alright , we do n't dress them up
because they are still wild animals .
and the show time is seven thirty , eight thirty , and nine thirty p.m .
% uh if the weather permits .
okay .
alright ?
so this is the shows that you can do-
% uh i would recommend a minimum of two hours in the night safari park .
of course if you can spend three hours ,
that would be better .
okay , so-
yah ?
so if you do n't want to walk ,
then forty minutes on the % uh tram ride .
but i definitely recommend you to do at least one walking trail
at the leopards trail .
yah .
% hm alright .
so i will show you the walking trails ,
because on the tram ride , you see seventy per cent of the animals .
the balance of thirty per cent you will have to walk .
ver~
so we divide the park into the various sector like himalayan foothills ,
the nepalese river valley .
okay .
equitoria~
so there is-
yah .
there is like % um a theme ?
yah for each of the sector .
so you will have % uh areas that stimulate
the natural habitat of these different animals that are found in these areas .
okay .
yah , so this is the night safari park .
yah .
right .
definitely .
yah , sounds interesting .
yah it 's a very popular tourist spot
for both the locals and the tourists .
right ?
great .
yah .
excellent .
so-
and i guess your nephew may also be interested to do
the jurong bird park as well .
yah okay .
let me see .
if he 's into birds .
yah , he is .
his-
okay .
he talks like a bird .
right .
alright .
non-stop .
so-
yah , we have like again different walks .
and i think you should not miss the lorry loft .
okay .
see now these lorries are free flying .
yah .
and you can feed them .
okay .
okay , but you can not feed them with human food .
% hm okay .
so we feed them with the honey water
and that 's available in the lorry loft itself .
huh .
so and the birds , the lorries will come and perch on your hand ,
to feed .
because when you 're holding this bowl of honey water , all the birds will come .
so it makes a very good pictures , alright ,
for your family .
okay .
great .
yah , and there are so colourful .
yah .
yah .
so these are the ones .
and of course also do not miss the show .
definitely i would like to % um watch the show .
yes .
and then % um-
so for % um how much does it cost to like % uh take the night safari and do the show ?
% uh night safari or show ?
% um both .
% um everything .
% uh both the night safari and the jurong bird park ?
yup .
'cause i want to spend the whole day in that area
with the jurong bird park and then on the night safari and then-
the zoo .
the zoo , yah .
okay .
okay .
so for adult .
okay .
for the adult it 's fifty eight dollars .
% uh the child is thirty eight dollars
for the three parks .
% ah okay .
jurong bird park .
so what you can do is you do the jurong bird park in the morning ,
there 's a zoo in the afternoon
and the night safari in the night time .
correct .
yah .
that 's what i want .
yah and that 's like a full day programme already .
% um % hm , yes .
so the night before , get a good rest .
right .
'cause you 're doing three parks in one day .
yes .
i 'm going to % um travel all over .
i 'm gon na visit singapore ,
the whole singapore if-
for three days .
okay .
alright .
and the following day , you can get a bird 's eye view of singapore
by going to take a ride on the singapore flyer .
singapore what ?
singapore flyer .
a ferris wheel .
flyer , huh .
% oh no .
i 'm afraid of ferris wheel .
i 'm afraid of heights .
but my sister could % um-
my sister and nephew could .
they 're braves .
but not me .
% oh you do n't like that ?
% oh okay .
okay .
so you stay on the ground and take pictures for them .
it 's a enclosed % uh ferris wheel .
it 's like a % uh cable car that goes in a circle .
yes .
yes .
% um if it 's enclosed , i think i might consider .
yah , there .
you see % uh the enclose , right ?
the enclose area .
% ah okay , yes .
because the ferris wheel here % uh are open ,
so i 'm afraid of them .
so if it 's enclosed , i think % um i would have the courage to take the ride .
alright .
right .
okay .
so you can do that and again if you want to do some local food the ground floor area
there is another % uh food centre on the ground floor area .
so % um is that % uh-
what 's that ?
% uh is that a bay beside the ferris wheel ?
yes .
% uh that is the marina bay .
okay .
the marina bay .
so it 's just very close by .
you can go to again , okay , that 's another view of the % uh singapore flyer it 's like a cabin .
okay , and then you saw the bay , right ?
the bay .
okay .
so you walk on this % uh bridge , a very interesting bridge that looks like our
% uh dna bridge .
okay .
to go to the marina bay sands .
and then % um-
okay .
at the marina bay % um % um are they allowed to % um swimming ?
do swimming ?
no ?
% uh okay , % uh yah , unless you are guest .
% uh and you are staying at the mari~
of course yes .
% uh otherwise , if you want to again have a bird 's eye view ,
% uh from singapore to the south china sea , to the city centre ,
% uh you can buy a ticket to go up to the skypark .
okay .
skypark , yah .
yah , right on top of the % uh three hotels .
can you see now the skypark ?
% hm yup , the deck view .
yah .
okay .
yes , so you have different % uh-
areas .
different view , alright ?
so you see the sea view ,
so that is towards % uh the south china sea .
okay .
okay , % uh from a three , number three , right up to number seven
you will see the city-
singapore city view .
% ah alright .
alright , so it-
could you see a very good view % uh of the skyline ?
if you wanted to see both ,
so you 'll have to be number eight i guess .
yes , correct .
but you can walk around , alright .
% uh you can around this % uh cantilever .
% ah okay .
okay , the cost of a ticket-
it 's twenty dollars for an adult and fourteen dollars for a child .
% hm okay .
yah .
yah .
okay , yah .
and % um once you come down , okay ,
you walk across the % uh underpass .
and you can do the restaurants .
okay , there are lots of restaurants out there .
% hm they have-
if you like chinese food , then maybe i can recommend you ding tai fung .
yah i like chinese food .
and there are lots of other kind of a cuisine out here
in the % uh marina bay sands area .
okay .
okay .
alright .
okay and of course but i guess with a kid ,
you may want to go to the casino , huh ?
i leave him with his mother .
and then i go to the casino myself .
% oh okay .
okay .
% uh the casino is just in the basement area ,
so you can have % uh some fun out in the casino as well .
% hm okay .
or you can even do % uh the museum .
okay .
is there any place that % um let say i 'm in the marina bay
% um marina bay sands ,
% um is there any place for-
where we could left off the children and then % um do the casino ?
yes .
okay , both of you , right ?
yah .
we do have a-
% um because % um % um here there are % uh places in malls were we could like % um
% uh leave the children and then we go to shopping .
and then the children will play on that area ,
and then we 'll get them once we 're done .
right .
yes , in the marina bay sands yes there is but not in all the other mall .
% uh only selected ones % uh do offer this service .
so you could do that , yah .
and i think he could be interested in this % uh arts and science % uh museum .
in the marina bay sands as well .
okay .
okay .
okay .
so this is % uh the permanent % uh gallery .
okay , that 's what you will see .
it 's all about arts and science .
% ah okay .
okay .
okay , so you could do that and that would be almost % uh more than half a day already .
correct .
and but of course again you can do a spot of % uh shopping out there as well .
okay , so % um a while ago i'll-
i saw a flea market .

the next picture again quite commonly seen in little india ,
these are flower garland shop .
% uh the white flowers that you see will be jasmine flower .

this is the main entrance of a hindu temple .
alright .
alright .
okay , again more street scenes in little india .
okay , another food that is served in little india .
so some of the local food will be like vadi .
vadi looks a little bit like a doughnut .
and you can eat it .
normally the store owner will give you a green chili as well .
so you take a bite on the green chili and a bite of this vadi
so it 's something very local .
okay , so more of like spicy foods .
% uh if you do n't want to eat the chili ,
then you just eat the doughnut .
the doughnut ?

can you help me with that as well ?
okay , sure .
and % uh is there any particular area of singapore that you like to stay ?
% hm , okay .
here is the deal .
i do n't , you know , i was never to do any research .
so you have to have to help with that .
i do n't know-
let 's pretend that
i do n't know .
no , we 're not pretending .
i really do n't know anything about singapore .
i just know % um my kids would probably want to go to universal studios .
and % um my husband and i would most likely enjoy
% um street food or food from hawkers or something like that .
my sister has gone to singapore like % uh
end of last year december , i think .
but i was n't able to ask about , you know ,
where to go and stuff like that .
yes .
so-
okay .
okay .
so % uh street food , it 's fine with you as well ?
yes .
alright .
okay .
so what i 'm going to do is % um i 'm going to show you % uh
a rough guide of the % uh mrt map
in singapore .
map ?
yes .
okay .
oh mrt , okay .
okay .
okay , i 'm going to show you the map .
alright .
okay i think it should be downloading now .
oh i can see it , but it 's too small though .
okay .
is it better now ?
oh % uh should i see a larger image
or is it just this small ?
'cause it 's like two inches by four inches .
well on my side it 's actually big .
okay .
anyway .
never mind .
% uh what i 'm going to do is % uh
if you look on the right-hand side of the map ,
that 's changi airport which is number three .
it should be a green line .
alright .
right-hand side .
okay .
so this is a map of the mrt .
okay .
mrt stands for mass rapid transit train .
alright .
okay .
do you know what all these colours means ?
no .
you see it's-
the picture is really very small .
very small , okay .
yes .
i ca n't see anything , just lines .
okay , i 'm trying to enlarge again .
it does n't help ?
no .
% uh , wait .
can you hold on a second ?
mr-
lynnette .
yes .
am i supposed to see a big picture ?
'cause it 's really rather small .
it 's just two inches wi~
yah it 's actu~
is it supposed to show on my screen ?
yah .
yes .
it 's supposed to be a big-
% uh the full screen .
the whole thing ?
oh no .
it 's just part of % uh skype .
i see .
just a small picture on the skype .
okay .
% uh , okay .
i think we forget about this map at the moment .
but let say if you-
are looking at the screen on the right-hand side will be changi
which is on the east .
okay .
okay .
so i see the green line .
yes .
or the red line will be the north .
alright .
okay .
on the left-hand side of the screen is the west .
that 's jurong .
okay .
is that % uh the end of the-
or continuation of the green line ?
the-
yes , that 's the end .
alright .
okay .
and if you look down on the % uh top-bottom part of the screen ,
that 's towards the south .
oh lynnette .
yes .
okay , it 's big now .
alright .
so let me check again .
i see green line .
which do i have to look at ?
the-
% uh just the green line or all of the lines ?
okay , you look at the green line number three .
changi airport .
number th~
okay , i see that .
yes .
so the-
can you just go towards your left
and you will see % uh the intersection between
the purple line , yellow line and red line .
yes , middle part ?
yah .
that is dhoby ghaut .
% uh huh .
dhoby ghaut .
what is dhoby ghaut ?
dhoby ghaut is-
all the names that is stated on the screen are mrt train station .
oh i see .
okay .
oh it 's gone .
it 's okay now .
% uh i do n't see the picture anymore .
oh there it is .
it 's back .
okay .
right .
so dhoby ghaut is a line
where you can change the different line .
oh i see .
okay .
so i need to get there to go some place else ?
% uh not , yah .
% uh not necessary .
depending on where you want to go to .
okay .
okay .
dhoby ghaut .
alright .
so what i can do is ,
you need me to recommend a hotel for you .
oh yes please .
so i need-
from the airport , where can i go to ?
where can we stay for the day ?
okay .
you can stay in the orchard road area .
what 's that again ?
orchard ?
o r c h a r d .
it 's on the red line .
% uh huh .
red line .
somewhere in the middle .
orchard ro~
% uh there , i see it .
yes .
okay .
so orchard station , somerset station , dhoby ghaut station
are on orchard road .
oh okay .
so this a road ?
orchard is a road .
is it a station as well ?
yes , it 's a road and there is an mrt train station called orchard station .
oh okay .
so from orchard we just look for a hotel .
can you recommend a hotel ?
alright .
on orchard road there are a number of hotels .
okay .
alright .
okay .
can i-
how much would you think you want to spend on a night stay ?
% uh how much is on average for-
not really an expensive hotel .
maybe a mid , maybe three class hotel -
three-star hotel ?
okay , i 'm listing to you
% uh some of the hotels in orchard road .
okay .
okay , let me ask you a question , lynnette .
'cause i only have say a thou~
i have a thousand dollars
and i need to bring my family to universal studios .
how much should i spend for entrance in universal studios ?
so i would know how much to spend for the hotel .
yes .
sure .
okay .
% uh , okay .
i will-
and % uh which % uh-
is it a weekday or weekend ?
% um , let 's make it a weekday .
a weekday .
my daughter is just five years old ,
can she-
will they allow her to go in-
to come in to universal studios ?
yes , she is allowed to go in .
but there are certain rides that she will not be eligible to take .
oh okay .
so there'll-
there 's gon na be like a height limit or age limit
for some rides ?
yes .
% hm shrek .
okay .
so you saw % uh the website , right ?
for universal studio .
yes .
alright .
okay , so some of these like i said ,
the % uh attraction , the rides ,
she may not be eligible to take .
okay .
can we just buy tickets when we come in there
or do we need to buy online beforehand or something like that ?
okay , it will be better to buy % uh online first
just in case % um all the tickets are snapped up .
okay .
so this is % uh universal studio .
yah .
how much were the tickets ?
okay , just give me a minute .
okay .
buy the ticket .
okay .
the ticket for the adult would be sixty eight dollars .
sixty eight .
yah , that is % uh non-par~
% uh weekday ticket .
okay .
okay .
any other charges , taxes or anything like that ?
% uh there 's no more taxes .
you can % uh use this ticket to use
% uh to take most of the rides .
okay .
alright .
and how about for kids ?
the kid 's price for the ticket is fifty dollars .
five zero ?
yes .
that is % uh non-peak hours .
okay .
oh but my son is already eleven and he 's tall .
so will they still consider him as a kid ?
and-
okay .
yes .
you bring your passport .
yes ?
okay .
so that means i need two hundred and thirty six dollars .
yes .
for universal studios .
for a weekday pass .
okay , just for the tickets .
any other expenses that-
aside from food .
any other things that we need to pay when we get inside ?
nope .
okay .
nothing else .
yes .
oh can we bring food or wo n't they allow food when we get in ?
% uh generally no outside food is allowed
inside the park other than
% uh where you get your food from the outlets .
the food outlets in the park .
okay .
so we can buy food from inside % hm , right ?
yes .
there are food available inside the park .
okay .
i 'll show you the dining .
what time can we go to universal studios ?
okay , they open early .
oh there .
yes .
ni~
ten a.m .
ten to nine p.m .
okay .
but-
yah .
wow that 's delicious .
that looks delicious .
okay , so what are the rides that your-
you think your son or your children will be interested to do ?
oh my son would most likely want to ride everything .
but my daughter , % uh just those rides for the small kids .
okay .
alright .
okay .
so do you-
how much-
how many hours do you think want to spend there ?
% hm i 'm not really sure .
'cause if we get a flight early in the morning
is it possible to check-in to the hotel ?
not yet , right ?
% uh no .
normal check-in time is % uh one o'clock .
% uh % oh yes .
sorry , at two o'clock .
oh .
two o'clock .
so that means if we 're just staying for a day
and we arrive early in the morning ,
where can we go then ?
can we go straight to universal studio
or maybe we can spend some place and have breakfast
before we go to universal studios ?
okay .
so what you can do is you bring your luggage , i guess .
okay ?
okay .
and go on the % uh mrt ride .
okay .
you will have to change station .
okay .
where can we go now ?
so in the morning , you were saying that you want to do some % uh breakfast first .
yes .
okay what were-
% uh do you want to eat in a hotel ?
do you want to eat in the % uh hawker centre ?
% uh what do you recommend for kids ?
something that they wouldn't-
they 'll enjoy .
do they mind % uh non-air-condition places ?
% uh oh !
how 's the weather in singapore by the way ?
is it a little hot or is it humid ?
okay the weather in singapore it 's average ,
about thirty degrees in the afternoon .
% uh in the early morning and late evening ,
% uh from eight o'clock onwards ,
temperature goes down to about twenty six degrees centigrade .
okay .
and so that 's not hot at all .
so may-
it 's okay if we do n't stay in an air-condition place .
but if you can recommend an air-condition place
then that 's fine as well .
okay .
so you want to go to universal studio % uh directly .
% uh we-
yes , after breakfast .
okay , we have % uh air-conditioned food centre % uh
a food court in the changi airport .
so there are street food out there .
okay .
yah .
lots of food to choose from .
% uh we have % uh chicken , % uh fried , braised , % uh chinese food ,
malay food which is a little bit spicy ,
indian food , as well as even fish and chips .
okay .
okay , this is chicken rice .
oh okay , i 've read about this .
hai-
is it like hainanese -
how do you say that ?
hainanese chicken ?
yes .
hainanese chicken rice .
you can have also like a dim sum , you know , small little bites ,
like pao which is like a-
taste a little bit like bread
but it has a filling in there .
oh is this what you were telling me about ?
% uh the-
near changi airport ?
yes , they do serve this kind of food
at the changi % uh food court .
okay .
changi airport food court .
changi -
okay .
so that 's where we stay when we arrive ?
yes , because you are going to arrive in the morning .
so , you can have your breakfast in the airport first .
okay .
okay ?
how much we spend for food for breakfast ?
a~
okay .
allocate with drinks per person % uh singapore dollars ,
% uh ten dollars per person .
and-
including drinks ?
yes .
okay .
so that will be like around forty dollars
for the four of us ?
yes .
right .
forty dollars .
so you can have a main course ,
that would probably cost you about five to six dollars .
and a drink which should be in the region of less than three dollars .
so a ten dollars is more than sufficient .
okay , that 's good .
so we have forty dollars for breakfast
and then we stay until what time
so that we can get to universal studios at-
by ten a.m .
yah , that is right .
so you would be buying your tickets online first ?
okay .
% uh yes .
so , but i 'm gon na include two hundred thirty six dollars
in my one thousand dollar budget , yes .
yes .
so now we are left with about three hundred dollars ?
yes , around three hundred .
% uh no .
two hundred-
two hundred thirty six plus forty that makes two seventy six ,
maybe % uh around seven hundred dollars left .
no , we are left is seven hundred .
okay .
that 's one thousand for the whole family , is it ?
yes .
okay .
alright .
so when you go to the universal studio -
how do we get to universal studios from the changi airport ?
okay , you will take the subway , the mrt .
okay .
take the west line .
west line is what colour ?
green colour .
oh green colour , okay .
yah .
yah , i 'm going back to the map again .
alright .
okay , can you follow the green line ?
oh i do n't see the map yet .
oh there it is .
can you make it bigger ?
okay , now i see it .
so from the airport , number three , right ?
yes .
three and then what do we do next ?
okay .
you go to the left-hand side .
and ?
% uh follow the green line .
yes .
okay , and you will stop at outram ,
is the cross-section between purple and green .
oh okay , i see that .
outram park .
yes .
outram park .
how much is the fare from the airport to outram park ?
yah .
okay .
% hm it should be in the region of two dollars and
it 's two dollar and thirty cents % uh for the standard fare .
okay .
and for-
how about for-
should-
am i going to consider your fifty eight cents per child or two thirty for all of us ?
for each of us .
yes , because we % uh the child ticket ,
we need the % uh student pass % uh fro~
for only for singapore student .
oh .
oh i see .
so that 's two thirty for each of us ,
around ten dollars .
yes .
we still have seven hundred dollars .
i 'm sorry .
okay .
so we have to allocate for your meals .
alright .
yah .
so % uh in the universal studio
there are dining available out there .
so we 'll probably have to spend for lunch and something that they can nibble on .
yes .
so there are % uh lots of food option
at universal studio .
there are fast food as well .
fast food .
yah .
oh do they have like games ?
'cause there 's a theme park here .
yes .
the last time my kids and i were there ,
we spend so much on games , you know ,
they need to spend for a token so that they can win a prize or something like that .
% oh okay .
% uh , sorry .
you were saying about games in the-
inside the studio .
universal studio itself ?
yes .
inside the park .
i 'm not sure .
okay , there are not really % uh games in there .
so we do n't have-
% uh you do n't really need to spend any more money
for the other % uh games .
okay .
alright , can you show me which % uh rides my little daughter can take ?
okay .
she can take like the % uh most of the other rides except
% uh where there is a height restriction .
like-
how about that transformer thing ?
will my daughter be able to-
how tall will she be ?
oh % um maybe just over three feet
or under four feet .
over three feet ?
yes , she should be allowed to go inside .
for transformers ?
yah .
oh okay .
% uh what 's nature and wildlife ?
what it is about ?
okay .
so % uh are you quite familiar-
are you okay with the % uh universal studio now ?
yah , maybe i can do that on my own when , yah .
i can check that out .
'cause that 's just % uh the website , right ?
yes , it 's a theme park .
okay .
okay , and there are also shows % uh where your daughter may enjoy the show .
timing wise ,
% uh well , it 's on the website .
% uh , yah .
do confirm the timing again
closer to the time that you are coming in
to the universal studio .
alright ?
okay , so you will sp~
so at this point of time % uh you 're still not sure
like how many hours you want to spend there .
yah .
okay .
alright .
okay , % um if we wan na go some place else ,
how many % uh-
% uh let me see , maybe we can get out of there around-
if we 're there at ten , how about three o'clock ?
can we do something else by three p.m . ?
yes , you can .
alright .
okay .
now , nearby-
you were saying you want to do a park , right ?
yes .
wait .
we do-
you can-
because the universal studio is at the southern part of singapore .
okay .
so you can go to the west .
okay .
% uh you can go to-
% uh maybe you can go because-
will you be staying one night in singapore
or you were proceeding straight to the airport
after the theme park ?
oh now-
well now that you 've shown me what to do the % um-
we 'll probably look for a hotel after this and spend the night
and just fly the next morning .
okay .
so what you can do is , you 're gon na fly next morning .
then maybe we go to the east , back to the east , alright .
i can recommend you this .
it 's like a water park .
okay .
oh .
yah . for your kids to enjoy .

that is in the east .
so the next morning , you can just take , you know ,

you can take the family ticket ,
that 's forty four dollars .
forty four dollars .
right .
family ticket , good for how many ?

two adults and two children .

so what time can we go here ?
okay .
this one opens as early as-
one p.m . to seven p.m .
one p.m . to seven p.m .
do you recommend that we go here after universal studios ?
i think they may be a little bit too tired already .
yah .
so the following morning .
yes , but the following morning the park -
unless it 's sunday % uh or saturday ,
then the park open at ten a.m .
oh this will not do .
because we 're flying the next morning .
so that means we , yah .
we ca n't come here if this opens at one .
any place else we can go to ?
oh you told me there is like a nature park .
yes .
is there one ?
okay , so do you just want to do a walk in the park ?
yes .
so that means you will leave the
theme park , the universal studio
at three o'clock ?
yes .
okay .
then nearby to the-
when you come out from sentosa
you will be alighting at harbourfront .
you 'll be coming out from harbourfront .

hortpark ?
yes , it 's called hortpark .
hortpark .
what can we-
what are we gon na see here ?

okay .
okay , it's-
% uh it 's not a very big park ,

how to get-
how do we get there ?
from universal studios , we 're supposed to ?

harbourfront , okay .

alright .
and you will go to the bus stop in-
harbourfront is a mrt line .
okay .
and you will go to a bus stop , a public bus stop

how long does it take for us to get there ?
travelling time approximately % uh ten minutes .
oh just ten minutes ?
alright .

and then stay there for
forty five minutes .
forty five minutes .
yes .
do we need to pay for anything or this is-
is this a public park ?
it is a public park .

this hotel call~
peninsular excelsior hotel .

or if you just want to do again very local ,
again there is a food court just next to your hotel ,
the peninsular excelsior hotel .
yes .
yah , so again you can get some street food out there .
% um is it safe to go out at night ?
'cause if we 're in the hotel and we 'd like to
like go outside for a few minutes maybe .
would it be safe ?
yah .
yes .
% uh singapore is a safe place .
but , you just have to , you know , take the usual precaution .
% uh avoid all the dark lanes ,
otherwise you can stay out late .
no issue with that .
is there like a curfew for people or not exactly ?
% uh no .
you can stay out the whole night if you want to .
okay , that 's good .
but , no , we ca n't leave the hotel .
'cause the kids are with us .
yah .
after the whole day at universal studio , right ?
yes .
yah , so i guess % uh-

and if you have beaches or probably just some resorts .
oh .
yah , we have beaches .
we have beaches % uh on the island .
and we also have an island called sentosa that you can go to .
% uh when you talk about hanging out , what do you mean actually ?
oh we love going to the mall and bar hopping .
oh okay .
% uh that 's % uh quite normal , right ?
mall % uh that means shopping .
% uh drink coffee in between your shopping .
yes .
right .
alright , and bar hopping .
alright .
alright .
% uh have you been to singapore before ?
oh not yet .
so that 's why we 're really excited to go there next month .
so i want to make the most of the vacation
so that 's why i 'm calling you so that-
i hope that you could help me out .
% uh yes .
% uh let me show you-
i think you sound quite independent .
thank you .
shall i show you the % uh mass rapid transit system ?
sure .
singapore .
so that when you arrive , you can take the train -
to go to-
from the airport into town the fastest way and % uh very efficient .
right .
mrt .
alright .
yes , mrt .
that stands for mass rapid transit .
here it is .
let me show you the map so you can see the whole of singapore also .
sure .
% uh just a moment .
take your time .
% uh where are you intending to stay ? uh
% uh where are you intending to stay ? uh
% uh what sort of % uh
% uh i do n't have the slightest idea at the moment .
so if you can help me find a really affordable hotel .
what do you think ?
okay % uh .
so that will be perfect .
okay , what you have here-
are you getting it on the screen now ?
yes , i can see it .
so do you see the green line at the bottom right-hand side ?
that is the changi airport .
and if you follow the line % uh from the right to the left .
you are entering into town .
alright .
and that is where we have maybe the better class hotels .
% uh it 's also the business area .
if you follow % uh a little bit further out .
you know where the green line hits the yellow and the red ?
the intersection , you mean ?
yes .
you follow the green line % uh up left towards the north .
you 'll get orchard .
do you see orchard ?
yes , i can see it .
orchard is a very popular road .
and that is-
you can get off there .
there are lots of % uh shops there .
night clubs .
if you go the other way when you take the train
and you go down to-
you switch to clarke quay , you could actually walk .
% uh that 's near one of our rivers called the singapore river .
and you might want to bar hop there at night .
well oh that 's perfect .
but how far % eh-
can you suggest a hotel ?
% uh an affordable hotel .
affordable as in % uh
what sort of price range are you talking about ?
because i 'll be having a thousand singaporean dollars with me .
oh that will go a long way .
just-
really ?
yes .
wow , so i hope you can help me find a-
because % uh you are-
% uh good place .
you are not looking for luxurious hotels .
no , not really
because we 'll just stay out most of the time .
so we 'll just go there to sleep .
we just need a place where we can sleep and relax .
% uh are you also % um-
do you mind if the place is a little bit crammed and % uh you know , not so large but % uh in a-
yah , that 's fine .
in a nice place of town .
so we just need two beds and % um a decent bathroom .
yes , that 's right .
and i do n't need a television , that 's fine .
they usually come with a television .
really ?
okay .
so that 's fine .
that will be perfect .
do you enjoy staying in chinatown or little india ?
% uh you know , those % uh what we call ethnic heritage areas .
wow .
okay , interesting .
so let me see .
so you step out , you can get chinese food or indian food .
we also have good class hotels there also .
really ?
the-
so long as i can go to the mall i mean
just walking distance so i can easily walk if i want to go to a restaurant or if i need to shop .
if you are-
clothes .
okay .
if you 're talking about a mall , are you talking about modern shopping centre or
we have also street side shopping .
small shops ?
small shops .
that will be fine .
okay , i 'm gon na get you hotels in chinatown .
okay ?
sure .
just .
so that 's great that i can spend one thousand singapore dollars .
yes , you would save a lot of money shopping .
really ?
because we 're worried that we need more than that .
so that 's a good news then .
% uh we have a good range in singapore .
you could spend it in one day .
you could spend it in a week .
in a week really ?
alright .
yes .
if your hotel is not too % uh expensive .
okay .
let 's see huh .
right .
because we 're planning to spend our money to , you know , to buy food and clothes and whatever .
just-
okay , are you getting the screen now ?
yes , i can see it .
so-
furama city centre .
i can see it .
affordable prices , yes .
this is chinatown -
which i think is quite interesting .
i will get you little india later if you want .
sure .
but chinatown is % uh you know , you can walk out and buy things from the shops .
you can also walk to the nearest % uh train station .
and get down to orchard road .
you could walk to your bus by the river .
right .
okay .
so i can see the % uh i think-
okay .
do you see
keong saik hotel ?
this one ?
yes , the cheapest one .
okay .
i 'm not saying anything .
i just thought that % uh
so have more money shopping .
yah .
yah , i can see you pointing it .
% uh huh , so that 's for ninety dollars .
yes .
alright .
and then-
let 's say-
well , that 's just-
these are all % um clean hotels .
you know , they are usually
do they have good feedback from their customers ?
feedback , you will have to google maybe and find out .
you see it has only twenty five rooms .
yah , that 's fine .
so let me see .
it 's a boutique hotel actually
do you see the hotel description ?
i got my arrow there .
right .
so what they 've done is they converted all shop houses into hotel rooms
so the hotel rooms are not % uh very wide .
perhaps % uh you can get off % uh your hotel room in about fifteen minutes -
go and have breakfast at the little shops nearby .
wow .
and % uh you know you could-
but the shops open a bit later .
maybe about ten o'clock .
ten ?
alright , that 's fine .
yah , right .
even the malls , they start up at about ten o'clock in the morning .
% uh huh .
but how long would it take if i 'll walk-
is it possible for us to walk from the hotel to the nearest mall ?
can you give me the nearest mall in that hotel ?
% uh depends-
so that we can shop .
mall-
oh yes , you could walk down to central mall which is-
central mall ?
by the singapore river .
one of our latest malls .
alright .
and % uh you overlook the singapore river if you
% uh for example have a ice cream in one of the-
there 's an ice cream boutique there .
there 's also % um coffee joints .
alright .
so that-
i think i 'll take that place then .
yah , ninety dollars only , right ?
and-
yah , that 's fine .
that will be perfect so that we can spend our money % um with food .
we can buy more food and clothes .
alright , but anyway-
yes .
yes , and you could hang out at the bars .
how far is sentosa from that hotel ?
% uh not far .
% uh you can % uh just walk to the nearest train station -
which is tanjong pagar .
and then you can take the train .
westwards .
% uh huh .
and % uh you get off at harbourfront .
and there you can take a shuttle into sentosa .
% uh really ?
but % uh can you tell me how much will be-
how much do we need to pay for the fare ?
oh it 's very low .
i do n't have the exact fare it goes by distance .
but what i advise is you get a card when you come in .
at changi airport , you go to the mrt station and you collect-
you pay in advance for a card with stored value .
and then before you go back , you 'll get your change if you hand it back in .
unless you want it as a souvenir .
alright , but-
so you 're only paying as a singaporean would pay .
% uh huh .
but how much do we need to spend if we 'll take the mrt all the time ?
% um how much do we need to allot for that-
if you are taking the trains and the buses -
transportation .
i think just maybe twenty dollars or even less .
it 's a-
it 's because of the deposit you have to pay but you 're getting it back once you hand in the card .
it 's for the manufacture of the card .
% hm i see .
so let 's say-
so if you are not intending to bring it back , you know , % uh it's-
it 's just the distance travelled and i think you will spend-
on travel , maybe only ten dollars or so .
unless you 're travelling all the time and you 're not-
heading off and shopping or eating , you know ?
alright .
or probably we can allot a hundred just to be safe for the fare .
oh .
no .
is that too much ?
no .
you do n't need so much if you are using buses than train .
oh perfect .
yah .
the only thing is if you take the train ride round singapore % um you have-
and you get off say one stop from your hotel .
% uh you will have to pay a two dollar surcharge .
% uh for using the train for too long because we do n't want people to hang out in the trains .
that 's all .
alright .
but if we 're going out at night , maybe you can suggest some restaurants or bars that we can visit .
% uh restaurants or bars .
you are thinking of what kind of food ?
% hm we love to try authentic food from singapore .
do you take-
oh yes .
great , authentic food .
let me see .
can you suggest a restaurant ?
yes .
% uh you know where you are in chinatown ?
we have a very old market that has been spruced up
and it 's one of my favourite places to eat .
we have also muslim food there and indian food but people go there for chinese food .
% uh let me try and see which there .
sure .
and how much do i need to pay for a meal for example ?
if you add a lot of food , ten dollars will go a long way .
yes .
oh really ?
ten dollars .
okay .
that 's a lot .
let 's say if you bought % uh different things and you tried it on .
assuming you have a big appetite .
% uh let me see if i can get this % uh-
take a look .
sure .
% uh maxwell market .
food centre , let 's see ,
can you see maxwell food centre there ?
sure .
yes , i can see it .
okay .
now it 's actually on the edge of the business district and chinatown .
oops .
and it would be within walking distance-
great .
from your hotel .
and really , you-
even if you stay somewhere else , this is a good place to try % uh local food .
and you should go there different times of the day
because in the morning you will get some stores that only sell up to lunch .
and there are some open at dinner time and supper time .
% uh huh .
wow .
and we 've got noodles , we 've got rice .
there are also-
% uh vegetarian stalls and % uh fish soups if you are thinking of something healthy .
% uh you-
do you have dietary needs ?
do you-
any of you-
% uh no , that 's fine .
we eat everything .
my best friend is always hungry so that-
we need to find the perfect restaurant .
oh so that 's good .
besides going to the market , there would be stalls just outside your hotel .
wow , that 's great .
% uh actually i should tell you that % uh your hotel is located in what % uh maybe
eighty years ago was a red light district -
but it 's full stop now .
so around that area , there are many % uh food stalls
% uh and % uh coffee shops we call them actually .
wow , okay , that will be great .
but can you suggest more activities that we can do together aside from malling and eating ?
% uh you want to go to % uh you was-
you mentioned the beach earlier , right ?
right .
so i 'm gon na get sentosa for you .
can i-
oops just a minute .
sentosa .
how far is sentosa from our hotel ?
okay , let me get back the-
okay , now .
you see where you are , you could walk to the % uh mrt station .
and % uh you could-
are you getting sentosa on your screen ?
yes , i can see it now .
so where you are is-
let me see-
tanjong pagar .
about maybe two-
just a minute % uh .
let me get on the train .
sure .
% uh can you see tanjong pagar ?
% uh right at the bottom on the green line .
right .
are you getting it ?
okay .
you go on the green line -
and you go to outram park .
and then you switch to the north east line .
the purple line .
you just go one stop and you 're at harbourfront .
right .
and then you can just ask anybody for directions .
the bus bay where sentosa operates shuttle buses into sentosa on a regular basis .
right .
oh i see .
% uh or you could take an express then you have to go-
that in fact there 's a huge shopping area there .
there are two shopping malls there , vivocity and harbourfront .
harbourfront is the older one .
at vivocity , on the top floor , you can get an express light rail system direct into sentosa .
wow , perfect .
but the easier way is you just go to the foot , the bus bay
because at the bus bay again , you can get a lot of variety of food .
malay -
this time you get more of the malay % uh that means % uh muslim food and indian food .
there 's also lot of chinese stalls , food stalls .
right .
right .
% uh the people who work at harbourfront at the malls , they often go across the road
to where the bus terminal is to get their food .
so it 's nice to check it out , you know , check it out first .
and if you still want to take the express train , you could .
you could cross the road and you make your way to vivocity and you can take the train in .
otherwise you can take the shuttle .
i think it cost about a dollar only extra on you .
wow .
a dollar would be perfect .
but how much do i need to pay if i 'll go to sentosa ?
for the-
do you have any entrance fee or do i need to to get there ?
yes .
yes , there are .
if you 'll go and swim , it 's just two dollars to enter .
but if you enter the attractions , then you have to pay more .
i would like to try the cable car .
do i need to pay extra for that ?
yes .
you need to-
actually the good thing is to get % uh
what do you call it ?
get to the top of mount faber which is near to harbourfront .
and % uh buy or-
buy a % uh sort of a package .
and from the package , you can get lower price entry to all the attractions .
alright .
oh let me show you some of the attractions first .
sure .
because the-
they are packaged in such a way that , you know , if you like adventure .
you 'll see imbiah lookout .
yes .
if you take the cable car-
you end up there on the island .
imbiah lookout is the-
is the stop .
and it 's on a little hill .
wow , that 's great .
from there you can walk to the butterfly park .
% uh you could % uh take a little ride , you know , on this little-
like sling down the little hill but this is a concrete trail .
and they have a short cable car there
but you want to take the main one across the harbour , right ?
right .
so when you 're there , you can check out all the places there .
there are-
you could walk to the beach from there too .
alright .
so-
and there 's a museum in what used to be
% uh former british military hospital converted to museum .
i suggest you visit that .
% um it 's called images of singapore .
let me see if it 's shown here .
sure .
because images of singapore gives you % uh the-
what can i see there ?
it's-
% uh the history of singapore .
wow .
alright .
so we love to see that as well .
and-
now on beaches , you 'll see what you see now .
do you see the dolphins ?
yes .
yah , and now do you see universal world ?
% uh huh .
if you like to go to universal studios , you could visit that .
that would-
cost a bit more money .
yah , like how much do i need to spend for that ?
can you give me an estimate so that i will know how to budget my money ?
maybe i say about fifty dollars or hundred dollars .
% hm each , alright .
% uh let me see .
can i get universal studios for you to get it more accurately/
so-
sure .
because there are rides that you can take there .
right .
so that 's why we 're not really spending too much for the hotel
because we want to go around the city and make the most of it .
but two days is a little short .
i think you need % uh five days .
okay .
yes .
probably next time .
okay .
universal studios % huh .
wow , resorts world .
so if you stay there , you would use up your thousand dollars very quickly .
a thousand ?
alright .
no i mean the hotel there would be , you know , more than a hundred dollars .
alright .
so we have these rides .
are you into rides ?
i mean % um-
not really .
yah .
so if you went and took these rides then , it would cost more .
but-
i think she 's not really into casino so that 's fine if-
yah .
so yes , that would save you a lot of money .
alright .
so but we 're planning to spend the rest of the day in that place in sentosa .
however % um how far is marina bay from sentosa ?
% uh it 's a different area altogether .
is that really far ?
% uh you have to get out of sentosa island first .
and then % uh you have to take public transport .
okay .
let me try to get you-
% uh do you have the map now ?
sure .
yes i can see it .
so marina bay , you 're lucky because the train has just % uh connected to marina bay .
that 's good .
so you would be at harbourfront when you 're on sentosa .
so you connect with the blue line .
you could either continue to dhoby ghaut and then switch to the red line .
and % uh that is also fun
because dhoby ghaut is a major interchange and there are lot-
there 's a huge shopping mall there .
so you might want to spend some time there before you change to the red line .
wow .
and go south to marina bay .
the red line is the newest line .
it 's the circle line but it has n't , you know % uh it does n't really form a circle here .
% um can you suggest some activities that we can do
at marina bay aside from we can swim as well and % um drink .
what else can we do there ?
anything that is % um fun or exciting .
% uh do you like concerts ?
oh yah .
sure .
that will be great .
i do n't have the date with me but % uh we can check out that .
esplanade , do you see esplanade ?
then stop here .
right .
we have major theatres there .
% uh esplanade theatres on the bay .
% uh theatre and a concert hall .
and we have shows there .
alright .
is it for free or do we need to pay ?
alright .
% uh we have lunch time concerts but that would be like once a month so-
% uh huh .
it may not coincide with the time you are coming but let me see .
april sixteenth .
yah .
okay , let me see .
okay .
yah .
yes , okay .
% uh huh .
okay .
esplanade theatres on the bay .
% uh huh .
no events .
i 'm sorry .
oh too bad .
yah .
% uh they are built like the old style microphones that have the % um the rounded tops
so it 's like two big caps % uh on the water , let me see .
let me just see if i can get you some photos here .
sure .
here you go .
have you got it ?
yes , i can see it .
it 's wonderful .
it 's nice to just go there and take photos .
and there are lot of shops in there too .
% um the shops would be not like your chinatown type .
they would be-
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
% uh good quality shops . % uh .
very nice place to hang out .
% uh huh .
% uh what did you say ?
your date was % uh weekend ?
is it a weekday ?
% um not sure .
i just booked on the sixteenth .
i 'm not really sure .
i do n't have the calendar right now .
april sixteenth .
april sixteenth .
april sixteen
let me check .
% ah you coming on a monday .
it 's a saturday .
no , sixteenth is a monday and-
oh let me see .
oh monday , sorry .
i was looking at twenty one .
sixteen , monday .
yah .
no , that is a-
i 'm not sure what they have % uh on those dates right now .
% uh okay .
just a minute .
that mean-
is it much better to stroll in a weekend or weekdays ?
% uh weekend is more % um fun .
it is more full of activities .
and when we are celebrating certain festivals like
chinese new year or the christmas , there are lots of free performances
just in the concourse area .
really ?
what about next month ?
do n't you have any-
% uh let me see % uh .
festivals next month ?
yah , i 'm trying to find it on their own website .
sure .
grounds , all events .
okay .
okay .
march .
oh dear , do n't tell me they only gave it for this month .
oh i think we need to reschedule our flight .
you have-
you-
you-
oh you can have a look at-
just to get an idea of what is on right now .
so you have an idea of what we have .
% uh huh , alright .
alright , i 'll take note of the website .
and maybe on the first of january you try it when you-
% uh first of april i mean .
but what is the peak season in singapore ?
just like in our country , it 's % um around summer time or-
% uh it 's usually school holiday time for the countries nearby and-
december .
% uh singaporeans also travel so-
% uh rather move around singapore 's attractions .
so we just had the school holidays over .
so that was one week of busy time at the shopping malls and the-
attractions .
% uh april , i think they 've all gone back to school .
so % uh it would not be so crowded
it would be quite relaxed .
alright .
wow .
perfect .
especially on a monday and tuesday i think % uh .
i find it a little bit too crowded down at orchard road on the weekends .
because everybody likes to go there .
right .
so i think it will be perfect .
i will just go there on the sixteenth .
no need to reschedule .
okay .
% uh are you getting the schedule now for april ?
% uh i 'm afraid the background is black so-
sixteenth .
let me see % huh .
sixteenth .
oh sorry .
okay .
we got a music concerto .
what % uh-
oh this is interesting .
did you see this ?
yah .
south mother africa .
right .
so that will be on the sixteenth .
yes , it 's a twelve to-
oh no , twelve to-
fifteenth .
% uh no , fifteenth .
okay , let me check .
no sixteen .
there 's no event on the sixteenth .
too bad .
there 's dance workshop on the seventeenth .
oh wednes -
the next day .
monday .
they take a break on monday .
alright , so maybe we 'll try the next day .
yah , unless you 're into dance and dance workshops on the seventeenth .
that 's what we have .
% that will be interesting then .
you want me to open this up for you ?
yah , sure , please .
okay , so three hour workshop .
and it 's only fourteen dollars .
wow it 's very cheap .
so i think we should take that as well .
i 'll take note of that .
and the person conducting
i think .
are there restrictions in your country like-
are we allowed to just stay at-
stay out % uh around one a.m . or two a.m . or that 's fine if we just stay until-
the next day .
you can stay as long as you like
but i do n't think % uh sentosa would like you to sleep on the beach .
that 's all .
right , so-
so when we have a beach party , they tell people that , you know
in the mornings , we have the shuttle buses to go out .
what time will they close then ?
the beach ?
% uh actually i do n't know about that , you know ?
but maybe the lifeguards will come around .
there are more worried about safety .
% uh huh .
so probably around six or seven in the evening .
oh you could stay later than that because we have beach bars .
wow .
alright .
% um but you know , being sentosa , the prices will not be the same as % um let 's say chinatown .
% uh huh .
% uh % hm , let me see-
but
okay .
if i can get the beach .
sure .
sentosa beach bars .
there you go .
so i hope they have an event on the sixteenth too .
okay .
% ah usually it 's on weekends , we have-
here you are .
okay .
see ?
wow , it 's a nice place .
so this is a bit more-
can we go snorkelling ?
pardon ?
snorkelling .
can we do that ? do you have extra activities ?
can we do that ? do you have extra activities ?
you could but frankly % uh you would have to take a trip to the island .
% uh one of our outer islands to do snorkelling % uh .
there 's not much underwater wildlife on that beach .
i mean it 's merely for swimming .
% uh because that 's what we want to do .
so can you suggest a place where we can go snorkelling ?
% uh snorkelling .
let me see % uh .
you would need to go with % uh somebody who organises it i would suggest .
% uh huh .
and i also think you should stay longer because otherwise-
it 's one whole day .
yah .
yah , it 's okay if we 'll stay there for the whole day
and then we can just shop the next day
because our flight is at night .
so we can maximise our time .
% uh no , i 'm afraid the organisers in singapore organise for outside singapore .
oh too bad .
there is one place % uh .
at sisters island but the waters there are quite rough .
oh .
and i 'm not sure because i do n't snorkel myself % uh .
or rather i-
% uh frankly i do n't snorkel in singapore .
oh really ?
you have n't tried it ?
no , because over there , it 's too rough for me huh .
i do n't swim .
i got to snorkel in very shallow water .
so i have to go to places where the fish come up to your feet , you know % uh in very little water .
so-
% uh huh .
can you give me an estimate let 's say if i 'll take advantage of this service or this package ?
so that i 'll have an idea how much do i need to save for this ?
snorkelling .
you need to hire a boat and % uh
wait % uh .
sure .
let me try to see if they have it somewhere else here .
sure .
'cause i do n't want to give you-
wait , sorry .
an estimate will do .
so-
but i heard that if you really want to shop % um nice gadgets or affordable gadgets
we can just go to singapore .
is that true ?
yes % uh .
you should bring extra money if you are buying like % uh-
yah .
lap-
you know if you are buying laptops or
you are buying something expensive then , you know , your thousand dollars will not % uh accommodate that .
let me see .
% uh hm .
right .
it 's a pity .
i have a niece who go snorkelling .
and she would yes , singapore .
really ?
% uh huh .
okay .
you should try that too , that 's fun
oh no .
it's-
the island i 'm referring to is too dangerous for me , i know .
or maybe the tourist guide can just help us .
% uh here , there .
do you see this ?
wow .
% uh and i have friends who go % uh surveying .
they 're actually doing it for nature .
okay .
so the waters frankly in singapore are not so clear .
the variety i 'm told is good for singapore waters .
% uh huh .
% uh huh i see .
so i think we just need to skip snorkelling and we just need to go around the city and try some food .
yes % uh i have to be frank with you % um .
yah , thank you for that .
you can use singapore as a base to maybe
indonesia or malaysia and try snorkelling there .
if you are , you know , very keen on seeing-
if you like-
you need to see the fish right in your eye .
% uh hm .
% uh hm .
colourful corals % ah .
right .
but if i want to buy some gadgets , where should i go ?
% hm what are you thinking of buying actually ?
% um i think my best friend , she wants to buy a new laptop .
and cameras .
laptop , i suggest you go to this place called funan centre .
it 's a it mall .
it mall .
okay .
yah .
okay .
are they on sale next month ?
will they be on sale next month ?
let me get into the website .
usually what i advise people to do is to-
okay , you have a picture of the mall there ?
yes i can see it .
go to the various shops and ask for the price of the item you want to buy
and tell them frankly that you are price checking so they will give you the best price .
and then after you walk around , you can come back to the first shop .
% uh huh .
alright .
so i think we should go there as well .
and how far is that from our hotel ?
how long would it take for us to reach that area ?
% hm you said you are good at walking , right ?
right .
you could walk there .
oh .
or you could take-
would that take us for an hour or-
no , i think maybe forty minutes or thirty minutes .
forty minutes .
or you could % um get on the street that is % uh facing the direction out of your hotel , the main street .
% uh hm .
and just take a bus maybe two stops and you would be there .
% uh % hm , i see .
but i 'm just curious % um how much do i need to pay if i 'll take the cab ?
because i notice that you 've been suggesting that i should take the mrt or-
because-
cabs are about three dollars upwards .
three twenty upwards % uh and it 's a-
we have some surcharges if you leave early in the morning like when everyone is going to office .
those are the peak hours .
and in the evenings .
but because we have the buses running also full steam and the trains they agreed-
if you miss the train this morning , it was two minutes before the next train came .
% hm i see .
so i think it 's really-
it 's also more fun for you , you know ?
you 'll get to see the local people .
how we move around .
% um and where you are .
like you-
i have told you , it 's so well connected .
you have lots of buses , lots of trains .
i see .
alright .
the taxis % uh in chinatown , you have to go to a taxi stop % uh to pick the taxi .
% uh huh .
but % uh which is safe ?
% um is it safe to take the cab or the mrt instead ?
yes % uh it 's as safe in both .
you just do n't take all your bling and hang it all around you .
% uh i do n't think you 'll be doing that , right ?
% uh just take the usual precautions .
alright .
right .
that % uh-
like i said you can't-
you can book the cab from your hotel or you can get reception to call you a cab .
but if you are sort of walking around chinatown , you need to find a cab station , you know , a taxi stand to get your cab .
they are not allowed to stop any and everywhere .
% hm i see .
but i 'm just wondering if you can suggest a place where i can buy souvenirs ?
cheap souvenirs .
oh .
chinatown would be the best place .
% uh there are street stalls and there are also shops .
but like i said , you might want to walk around the whole place first .
and find out .
but usually in chinatown , they are more or less the same price for the cheap souvenirs like
three items for ten dollars .
% hm not bad i think .
and there would be different sort of items .
alright .
so i think % um you were able to answer my questions and thank you for being patient
because i have-
i asked you a lot of questions today .
% um i 'm very sorry i ca n't % uh give you better news on snorkelling .
% uh huh that 's fine .
but you can come to singapore and use the services of the companies that organise
for singaporeans to go snorkelling nearby .
you know , and it would not be expensive , you know ?
alright .
i see .
but % um can you give me some tips or
what are the things that i should remember if i go to your country so that
the police will not call my attention or-
% uh say again .
sorry ?
% uh hm .
% uh huh .
can you give me some tips that-
i mean the things that i need to remember so that , you know , i will not commit mistakes or-
nothing bad will happen if i go there .
% uh huh .
okay .
like i know that we ca n't chew gums and we ca n't smoke everywhere so what else maybe ?
you can chew gum in singapore , you just can not import gum .
that 's the miscon-
you can bring in gum but if you brought in a whole carton % uh the customs would-
will take it away from you because they will assume you are selling it .
so if you bring gum for two days and say it 's for my personal use , i do n't think anyone will stop you .
% uh the only thing is when you dispose of your gum
you have to make sure it 's wrapped up and thrown in a bin .
or some people carry a little plastic bag and put it in the handbag
until they find a proper dustbin to throw it .
% uh you also-
some tourist carry a little-
do you smoke ?
oh yes .
so , you know , they have a little gadget for holding your ashes when you are smoking .
% uh i 've seen a tourist used it .
i thought it was very cute .
you-
so that you can smoke % uh at designated areas
but if there 's no bin to dispose of your cigarette after you smoke
you just keep it back in the container .
it 's just so that you do n't break the anti-littering law .
right .
although most of the time , nobody gets caught .
so % uh singapore may not be as clean as you imagine it to be .
right .
% uh the restaurants also % uh they have a restriction on the place where you can % uh eat and smoke .
so it 's usually outdoors .
so it will be clearly marked out .
so you have to seat in that area which means if there are only 3 tables and they are taken
then you have to go to a non-smoking area and you can not smoke there .
okay .
alright .
so great
and thank you for helping me , jeanne
and i think one thousand dollars will be enough for me .
right , maybe we just need to bring extra money then .
bring extra money for shopping , is it ?
right .
% uh there-
you still have some time with me so if you want to ask anything else .
% uh shall i go to some other sites for you ?
let me go down .
okay .
% uh clarke quay .
okay you mentioned % uh-
okay .
not spelt it correctly .
the bar hopping i remember .
alright .
yah .
we missed that .
yes .
so i 'm going to clarke quay .
oh clarke quay bar .
no , this one is for-
okay .
i 'm just curious how much do we need to pay if we 'll drink .
% uh actually on a weekday .
i 'm not sure if it 's tuesday or wednesday .
some bars have a women 's night .
wow .
where you get it free .
the only thing is you have to dress like a woman .
% uh huh .
of course .
they have % uh refused to let some women in who were dressed
% uh not like women if you get what i mean .
% uh and % uh senior citizens .
did they get discounts too , senior citizens ?
no , they-
you see , they want the ladies to attract the men there .
oh that 's why .
so % uh-
he-
they 're giving drinks for free .
yes , the ladies get in for free .
usually the cover charge is maybe twenty dollars or-
a weekday is lower than % uh weekends .
maybe just fifteen dollars .
alright .
oh that 's good .
buy one get two cocktails .
% uh see-
can you see here ?
% uh let me try and get it here .
there you go .
right .
okay .
good .
and lunch -
a lunch at clarke quay unless they have changed it , it 's only about fifteen plus .
% uh at clarke quay .
i 've done a walk there myself and % uh i was very tempted to go in and eat .
so tuesday is drivers ' night % huh .
right .
okay , that 's good .
i do n't know how you-
oh you got to be a certified then .
do you see this ?
drivers ' night ?
yah , yes , i can see it .
so if you have your driver 's license .
no .
too bad .
if-
you know ?
oh .
free flow house pour jug .
the whole jug at thirty dollars .
usually it 's the wednesday night that 's on-
wednesdays and thursdays .
on wednesday .
alright , so let 's see if we can still adjust the flight .
so that we can take advantage of the ladies night , wednesdays .
that is % uh-
yes .
% hm and i suggest you stay a little bit longer because it will allow you to see more things .
alright , okay .
so maybe one thousand will really help me .
one thousand dollars will be really good for us .
so i bet my best that i 'll bring extra money to get the most of it .
that will be perfect .
you-
you may-
yes , for your shopping and % uh you might have extra money to go home .
or you could , you know , fill up with your shopping .
let me see if i can get orchard road shops for you % huh .
% uh huh .
yah , sure .
will it be really hot next month in your country ?
% um it 's hot and sometimes wet throughout the year .
so yes , my advice is to bring a cardigan
more for the , you know , if you go in the bars , sometimes they 're cold or the restaurants .
or the air conditioning within % uh certain areas .
% uh let me see here .
okay .
sure .
the outside area would not be hot -
% uh would not be cold .
although % uh these few months , we had some cold evenings
which is very nice if you enjoy walking out in the open .
wow .
so in the evening times , many people go out and walk because they find it-
well , firstly if they work in day , they have time only in the evenings .
alright .
yes , so here you see a scene of the light up .
can you see it works ?
wow .
amazing .
that 's at christmas time .
% uh you come to see the light up .
% uh 5huh .
wow .
but at the time you come , you can-
we are now linking up the shops in orchard road so
% um it 's not hundred per cent connected but like maybe eighty per cent .
you can walk from mall to mall without getting wet .
and as you say you enjoy walking-
right .
it 's not a problem .
so we have the high-end , gucci .
we have also in bet-
in some other shopping centres , we have % uh non-branded items .
right .
so maybe we can just take pictures .
and look around .
no , you can buy .
like i said there are shops % uh that are not gucci and cartier .
% um have you heard of things like g2000 ?
yes .
yes % uh .
i think we also have that store in this-
in our country .
they are regular .
% uh % hm regular brands .
and you can buy your souvenir t-shirts in chinatown .
perfect .
alright .
so i think that will be all for today , jeanne .
and thank you for helping me and i was able to find a very cheap hotel so-
perfect .
i hope you 'll come and % uh stay a few more days .
% uh huh .
right .
yah .
sure .
yah .

it 's called the botanical gardens .
and also-
% um lynnette , could you also % um please show me a % um
% uh you know , my best friend and i really loves partying and % uh % um we 're won-
we 're also wondering if there are % um clubs or % uh you know bars in singapore that we can definitely go .

thank you .
so do you want me to show you the gardens first ?
or what do you want ?
yah , sure .
okay , the gardens first ?
yah , the gardens first .
alright .
okay .
this is the botanical gardens in singapore .
okay .
you can be there as early as five a.m. to twelve midnight
but i guess you wo n't be spending that many hours there .
yah oh-
well % um you know % uh taking photographs will be good % um for % uh around six o'clock in the morning
and up to nine o'clock in the morning because of the % uh-
% uh the natural colours will be great to the camera .
okay .
so you can be-
anyway the park opens as early as five a.m .
% uh % hm yes .
alright .
% uh so you can be there .
alright , and anytime you are ready to leave , you can leave the gardens .
alright .
okay .
but if you have-
if you plan to spend a bit more time , you can go to the orchid garden inside the botanical gardens .
but that is-
there is an admission charge there .
but the orchid garden only opens at eight thirty .
oh .
so do you know what you 're going to see in the orchid garden ?
% um yah i suppose .
% um orchids and-
would there be any other plants there ?
% uh majority would be orchids .
% hm alright .
okay .
but the botanical gardens , you will have all the other plants out in the botanical garden including a small jungle .
% uh % hm perfect .
that will be perfect .
yes .
and there will be some birds % uh there as well .
okay .
so this is for the garden visit for your plants and a little bit of wildlife like the birds
% uh so you can do that in the morning .
% hm alright that 's great .
okay .
okay .
so is there any other information that you require for the % uh photography session ?
% um i think that will be all .
okay .
do you need me to tell you how to get there ?
and-
yes please .
okay .
now assuming that your hotel is somewhere in orchard road , there are buses available .
these are the buses available .
% uh there are quite a number of buses , it 's all stated on the website .
okay , if you want to take the mrt train station -
mrt , the subway trains .
% um yes .
% uh yes .
it is also possible .
% um but what if we % uh take the mrt station ?
do we have to take any other vehicles or we just have to walk ?
% uh yes .
you 're actually right there -
at the eco % uh garden .
this is at the north end of the gardens .
% hm okay .
yah , it 's quite close to the garden already .
great .
yah .
otherwise if you % uh
because there are many entrances and exit to the garden itself .
yah .
so % uh it 's fine , if you take the mrt , you can arrive at the % uh mrt % uh
the botanical garden station .
% uh okay .
okay , so .
so we can close this % uh website .
yes .
okay .
so next , we want to go to the % uh universal studio ?
yes .
can you please show me around ?
okay , sure .
okay , this is % uh some of the photos that you can get % uh to do
when you see the % uh hollywood characters .
so your main period-
yes ?
oh .
% um well i 'm just gon na ask if the universal studios is near from the botanical garden .
% uh you-
it is % uh-
the-
so are you thinking of after your morning photography student-
% uh studio % uh-
photography session to proceed straight to the universal studio .
% um yes .
okay .
% uh it is not that far away .
alright .
what you can do is you go back on the mrt .
% hm yes .
and you take the circle line .
okay .
% uh and you will alight at the harbourfront .
yes .
and then % um-
yes .
in harbourfront , you will % uh get in using the % uh the sentosa express .
alright .
to get into the universal studio .
yes .
% uh alright .
so % um again after % uh we ride the mrt
it is straight to the universal studios entrance so we do n't have to ride another % uh another bus or any other vehicles .
% uh no .
from the botanical garden , it 's % um mrt
and you can change the sentosa % uh train at harbourfront .
train .
% uh okay .
yah .
so that 's how you can get in .
and straightaway when you alight % uh at the station % uh to-
by taking the sentosa express , you 're already at universal studio .
okay .
alright .
okay .
so % uh it will be just about right because the opening hours , opens at ten a.m .
right through seven p.m .
and also lynnette % um do you know % uh
how much will be the entrance fee there in universal studios ?
it's-
okay it 's sixty eight dollars .
sixty eight dollars .
okay , thank you .
per person .
per person .
alright , thank you .
yes .
okay .
these are the tickets here .
okay , and these are the rides that 's available .
are those rides % uh are those rides inclusive of the % uh entrance fee
or do we have to pay % uh another % uh for that-
for the rides ?
no .
the-
most of the rides are included unless they say that for example like the % uh
amber rock climb .
that 's % uh additional charges for the children .
this one is for the children .
okay .
% uh otherwise most of the rides would be already included in your ticket .
% hm okay .
alright .
okay .
% hm alright .
so % uh the-
i think the transformer ride is very interesting .
% uh % hm yes .
okay .
alright , so this is the universal studio .
and how much time do you think you want to spend there ?
% um well i think % um-
well just before dinner .
oh before dinner .
yah .
alright .
okay .
so in the night time , you want to do % uh-
you want to go to a bar .
yah .
alright .
okay .
so you can go to this very famous bar .
it 's called zouk .
zouk club .
z o u k .
okay , yah .
zouk club .
yes .
okay , this is the park .
yah , this is a club .
alright .
okay .
these are some of the events , the past event .
okay .
yah .
do you need me to tell you the dress code ?
% um yes please .
okay .
dress code will be % uh party attire .
and because they have won % uh few years .
for a number of years , they have won the nightspot of the year .
it 's a pretty good place actually .
yes .
okay .
perfect place for partying and clubbing .
did-
yah .
and do you need me to tell you how to get there ?
% um yes please .
okay .
again it 's quite accessible by the % uh subway train station .
you just have to walk a little bit .
the closest station would be % uh at the tiong bahru mrt train station .
okay .
so actually it 's a pretty big place and % um from the % um station -
from the mrt station % uh we can definitely see the lights from the club , right ?
% uh it 's about ten minutes ' walk from the mrt .
well , you do n't have the lights out there .
it 's % uh pretty % uh simple on the outside
so you do n't see like a lot of % uh new lightings .
but it is % uh one of almost % uh world famous club % uh in singapore .
so if you want to party % uh this will be one of the nightspot .
oh .
okay .
okay .
yah .
okay .
another club that i can % uh recommend you will be called
okay , this is the other % uh club .
alright , that % uh we have in singapore .
yes .
which is again pretty % uh popular with the local as well as the tourists .
okay , it 's called one-altitude .
oh % um by the way lynnette % um
yes .
% uh the % uh what do you call this ?
% um % uh at what usual time does the op-
you know the clubs open at night ?
okay , usually people would start going in by ten o'clock .
alright .
and it finish late like till two a.m .
two a.m .
yah .
this is about the usual time that people goes to the club .
% uh % hm okay .
and the other % uh club that i like to introduce you would be called one-altitude .
wow .
okay .
so this is % uh-
you have top of the world feeling .
this is-
it 's actually a bar .
a gallery and bar .
it 's really % uh a pretty nice bar .
yes .
you got a good view % uh from the top of the building .
alright .
% um and how do we get there ?
okay , again this is very accessible by the mrt .
you alight at raffles mrt .
raffles place mrt and it 's just right there .
% uh huh .
% hm okay .
okay .
okay so you have two clubs to go to already .
is it-
and also lynnette % um we also plan on the second day % uh if you happened to know-
% um where we can buy % uh branded clothes but , you know , for cheaper prices .
okay .
alright .
we have along orchard road lots of shopping .
and also if you can please show me % um how to get there % uh from our hotel ?
okay .
thank you .
let me just show you this .
okay .
now this is a shopping complex called paragon .
okay .
% uh it is located on orchard road .
and the closest mrt train station would be called orchard station .
it 's just five minutes ' walk from orchard station .
okay , that 's great .
alright .
so this is one option , other the other option-
so you have all the branded goods out there .
and because you are a tourist , now , when you buy something from a bigger company .
% uh remember to get the gst tax refund .
gst tax refund .
it 's the-
it 's the vat , you know ?
but we call it gst here .
it stands for goods and services tax .
alright .
okay when you get the form % uh you can always claim back the seven per cent
upon % uh you leaving singapore .
oh and % um where do i claim that ?
okay .
now if you are going to put your purchases in your handbag
alright .
it 's okay .
you will check-in as usual at the check-in counters .
okay .
after you get your boarding pass , you go inside the immigration .
okay .
immediately after the immigration , you will be able to see a big sign that says gst .
oh okay .
okay , just approach counter with your purchases and your % uh receipt
alright , that has been stamped % uh by the retailer and you present this to the officer .
and they will be able to refund you , your money in whatever currency you wish .
or to % uh mail back the % uh refund to you via your % uh credit card
to credit back your gst % uh to your credit card .
so it 's very easy .
oh okay .
yes .
okay .
if you want to put your purchases in your luggage , then it 's slightly different .
% um well do you have-
do i have to go to the % uh-
straight to the immigration and % um
you know , refund the gst again to that counter or would there be any other process for that ?
okay .
what you can do is your purchases are going to be put inside your luggage
when you arrived in the airport -
okay .
at both ends of % uh at one end of the airport area , you will find a gst counter .
okay .
now bring your purchases , your % uh receipt to the-
and of course your passports and tickets .
and bring it to the officer that 's located there .
okay .
present all these items and the officer will do a stamp for you .
okay now , bring everything to do your normal check-in at the check-in counter .
okay .
once you have done your check-in with your boarding pass , proceed into the immigration counter
and you look for the gst sign again and you will be able to get back your tax refund .
okay .
okay .
% uh sounds easy ?
oh thank you .
yah .
okay .
alright .
so that 's how you claim back the gst .
gst .
yah , thank you for that lynnette .
and-
okay , so this is one % uh shop but to the shopping again for your branded goods .
this would be one of the options .
i think the prices here for branded goods are still % uh very competitive .
alright .
now another shopping centre , you may want to consider would be a nice shopping centre called ion .
in the % um-
is it close to the % uh paragon shopping centre ?
yes .
% uh park .
close to the park .
sorry , which-
no % um the paragon shopping centre .
oh yes .
again this is just-
this is even nearer to the orchard mrt train station .
when you exit from the mrt % uh this is the shopping centre .
now well if i 'm coming from the % uh paragon shopping centre .
% uh do i have to ride anything or we can get there by just walking ?
yes , just a five minutes ' walk .
% oh okay .

it 's just beside ion .
% uh you have ion , then you have another shopping centre called wisma atria .
and then you have this big shopping centre called ngee ann city .

% um well actually % um any kind of clothing .
% um % uh from dresses % uh blouses , t-shirts , you know , oh for souvenirs also .

yes .
so how about food wise ?
% uh what kind of food do you like ?
% um % uh actually we would like to try singaporean foods .
okay , singaporean food .
yah , okay .

then you go to next door called wisma atria .
there is a food court .
and you can try some of our local street food out there .
% hm and % um-
well actually we do n't have any idea what to try there .
so % um % uh you know , i was wondering if you do have % uh one in mind that you can definitely % uh refer us to try .
okay .
% uh okay .
the wisma atria is called % uh food republic .
yah .
% uh and one of the local food that i would like to recommend you would be fried hokkien noodles .
oh was that fried-
sorry ?
% um oh was that-
i 'm sorry , i did n't get that .
% uh fried hokkien noodle .
% uh % hm okay .
so basically what is it made of ?
% uh this is actually made out of the yellow kind of noodles .
yah .
can show you how it 's done-
hokkien noodles .
this one .
wow , it has prawn on it .
i think that would be perfect because we both love seafoods .
% um lynnette .
yes .
i think that 's enough , right ?
okay .
so basically we fry this % uh dish
% hm yah .
okay .
so % uh
okay , i think we have enough of the food otherwise we get too hungry .
yes .
okay , and now what 's % uh-
so let 's go back to % uh paragon again .
yup .
okay .
alright .
so that 's too % uh attract you to try this local food out here that is very popular in singapore .
% uh of course we have a lot more % uh dishes .
% um okay .
% uh for example we have satay in singapore .
satay ?
yah .
it 's a meat-
different kind of meat that is pierced through a skewer and it 's barbecued over % uh charcoal .
okay .
% uh yes .
that is something you want to consider as well .
oh let me put that on my list .
i 'll definitely try that .
and of course our very famous % uh chicken rice .
chicken rice .
alright .
yah .
% um would that all-
i guess that will be % uh that will cover up our two days trip in singapore .
okay .
so % uh do you still need to do some more photography session ?
% um % uh well , do you have any place-
% uh any more places % um-
besides the botanical garden that % uh you know , that 's great for % um photography ?
okay .
we have another place called % uh the % uh sungei buloh or even bukit timah hill .
okay .
do you like to do a little bit of % uh climb ?
% um yah .
okay .
so i can recommend you bukit timah hill .
and basically what are the % uh you know
what can i basically see there ?
okay , bukit timah hill is singapore tallest hill .
oh .
alright .
yes .
and % uh again , there are lots of flower and fauna .
a bit of % uh a bird 's life .
okay .
but i would say it 's small birds and fauna .
and it is popular with the local who goes for the morning or evening walk up the hill .
okay .
and % um also , how do we get there % um-
assuming we 're coming from the % um hotel .
okay .
okay .
you will have to take a bus .
because right now the mrt is not ready at this moment .
so you will have to take a bus to go there .
okay this is % uh just a photo scene .
lots of trees .
wow .
okay .
% uh of course , you will get to see some monkeys as well .
% uh do not touch them .
okay , so-
and-
you will have to take a bus called % uh bus one seven zero from orchard road .
and % um how long would it take to get there ?
okay .
% uh allocate about % uh forty minutes bus ride .
from orchard .
weighting time approximately about fifteen minutes to get to this park .
well % um-
well lynnette , i think % uh that will be all % uh for % uh our two days trip in singapore .
and % um basically that will cover most of % um our trip .
and % uh-
and also % uh by the way % uh just one more thing .
% uh do you have any place % uh well i have-
i 've heard this from my % uh from my sister 's friend
because they 've been to singapore % uh a place called little india .
okay .
yes , we have this place called little india .
and % uh this is a ethnic area in singapore .
alright .
so traditionally % uh the indians used to live here in the past
okay .
okay , i 'm just going to show you some images of little india .
okay , can you see ?
it 's a very colourful area .
is it a market ?
% uh on what kind of market are you talking about ?
pretty much % uh any kind of market like % uh anything goes around there .
okay .
there is a wet market in little india mrt train station .
% uh they sell-
it 's like a non-air conditioned supermarket .
so all the stores sells meat , vegetables , flowers % uh and they open till twelve o'clock in the afternoon .
so there is the market if-
i understand what do you mean by market .
oh yes .
okay .
so would you want to try some indian food ?
% um yes definitely .
okay .
now i 'm going to show you this food .
it 's colourful , right ?
yes .
very colourful .
okay .
this is called indian rojak .
so you would pick the different dishes that 's % uh available in the store .
okay .
and the vendor , the food centre will cook for you .
it 's mainly deep fried .
alright .
and they serve you with this orange coloured gravy .
% um yes .
yah .
which is not that spicy .
it ' just a tinge of % uh spice in there .
okay .
and % uh so it 's like everything mixed together so we call this indian rojak .
indian rojak .
yah .
now if you-
okay .
so this is one dish .
okay .
and-
okay .
are you also
% uh do you want to eat other things-
oh yes .
in little india ?
yes .
okay .
% uh we have like chapatti .
is that also an indian food ?
% uh yes .
it 's a kind of bread made from wheat flour .
okay .
and there 's also other kinds of bread like % uh curry naan .
okay , this is the picture of the bread , the naan .
okay , you can eat it plain , you can have garlic naan .
so it 's actually taste quite good on its own .
you can dip them with curry .
chicken saag curry , mutton curry .
and you can have another version % uh of like pancake , indian pancake that 's called % uh roti prata .
okay .
so these are quite typical % uh indian food that we have here .
so it 's so colourful .
i think you may also get good pictures down in little india .
% hm yah .
very % um-
very indian .
with all the colours and also % uh lynnette
can you please show me % uh around at % um sentosa ?
okay .
now sentosa % uh universal studio is in sentosa .
so basically it 's % um it 's a city there
and % uh what else can i find there besides from the universal studios ?
alright .
okay .
it 's a whole island of % uh recreational % uh activities that you can do there .
okay , so you have the beach .
okay , can you see the bottom part ?
that 's the beach area .
yah .
% um can you please % um % uh show me around the beach .
the beach , okay .
we have a few beaches out here .
yes .
so i like to show you this pahlawan beach .
okay , this is the beach out on sentosa .
this is called pahlawan .
then we have siloso beach .
okay , these are basically lagoon so % uh the % uh it 's a nice place
and you can see people also playing % uh beach volleyball .
so and % um also-
how do we get there ?
% uh same thing .
you can-
if you 're on universal studio , you can just take the beach
% uh the sentosa express , the train on sentosa and you alight at the beach station .
okay , and you 're at the beach .
so it is better to do % uh universal studio together with the attractions on sentosa .
% uh % hm yes .
and also what other-
% uh aside from beaches what % um other activities can we % um find at sentosa ?
okay .
you can do the spa .
okay , can you see the-
a number of spas there .
would you-
do you like to do spa ?
% um yes of course .
okay .
the mon-
% uh there are about five spas that 's available % uh on the % uh island itself .
% hm well i think that % uh % um
i 'm pretty curious about the fish reflexology underwater world .
okay .
okay .
okay , this % uh fish reflexology , it 's % uh like a foot massage .
but they use the fish .
so these fishes will actually eat up all your % uh so called % uh dead skin .
and they-
so what you will feel is this nibbling , ticklish % uh sensation .
so what the fish do is they nibble at your ni-
dead skin .
oh .
okay .
so it 's quite % uh unique .
i think we 'll gon na try that .
okay % huh .
yah .
so the cost , do you want to know the cost ?
yes please .
okay .
now , this % uh they have different time % uh
kind of % uh package .
alright , if it 's % uh forty minutes , that would cost you thirty eight dollars per session .
and % uh fifty minutes will cost you fifty two dollars per session .
and that fifty minutes % um includes the full fee of the reflexology and also the massage ?
% uh no , it 's just the % uh fish nibbling at your feet .
this is the fish reflexology over at the % uh underwater world .
oh okay .
% hm okay .
okay .
the % uh-
there are other % um-
for the-
if you want to do this fish reflexology
% uh you can actually combine it with going into the underwater world .
because % uh they charge for % uh the-
okay , can you see now ?
the fishes are-
you dip your feet into this pool and the fishes would nibble at your % uh feet .
and it's-
% uh yes .
yes .
alright .
and of course if you want to do body massage , these are the various % uh
% uh centres that you can % uh do your body massage .
okay .
well % um also in that % uh
just popped up in my mind .
% uh can you please % um % uh-
what about the % uh night safari ?
okay .
night safari % uh opens in the night time .
and where is it located ?
it is located in the north of singapore .
you will have to take % uh mrt and a bus .
again-
again from the % uh hotel ?
yes .
okay .
okay .
so this is the % uh night safari .
wow .
okay .
that 's also great for % um our photographing session .
% uh okay .
when you are inside the park
because this is a park that opens in the night time .
% uh if you want to take photography % uh you would have to take it without flash .
oh okay .
okay , for-
if you 're taking on the animals , then you have to take that without the flash .
flash .
alright .
yah .
yah .
i 'll take note of that .
and also lynnette % uh do we have an entrance fee for that ?
yes .
and how much it cost ?
does it cost .
alright .
okay .
park .
just for the % uh night safari park , right ?
% uh % hm yes .
but basically lynnette , what are-
what do i-
what should i expect to see % h in the night safari ?
% uh in the night safari , you would see % uh things like % uh the giraffes -
okay .
% uh the malayan tapir , the leopards .
okay .
so these are the things that you 're going to see in the % uh night safari park .
the % uh okay .
% um okay .
so these are the-
alright .
alright .
it should cost you about seventy % uh two dollars .
and % uh you do n't have to walk in the park if you do n't want to .
oh % uh there is a % uh what do you call that , safari ride ?
yes .
it 's % um tram .
okay .
% uh huh .
so you can get on the tram ride
and % uh you will see more than seventy per cent of the animals .
and % um the-
is it included in the % uh ticket ?
yes , the tram ride is included in the ticket .
the whole ride will cost you forty minutes .
okay .
alright . it will take about-
alright . it will take about-
it will take you forty minutes to go around the park .
% uh and if you do n't want to take the tram , you can do walking as well .
% hm but will i be ab-
if i-
if we choose to walk , would we able to see % um you know , the % uh the animals also ?
% uh yes , you can also walk .
there are three trail , that 's one that you 're looking at .
it 's called the leopard 's trail .
% uh on this trail , of course you see other animals but the highlight would be to see the leopard 's trail .
there is another called the fishing cat trail .
% uh this is located near the entrance area .
and also % um lynnette , could you please % um
% uh tell me more about the shows there at night safari ?
okay .
there are % uh two shows there .
okay , one is called the % uh-
okay , this show here .
the first picture that you saw , okay , is the fire show .
% uh and the other one would be the creatures of the night .
that 's what you 're looking at now .
okay .
okay .
this is the % uh-
okay , this is the creature of the night .
now basically it 's a twenty minute show % uh
and they will just bring out some animals for you to see .
the show timing would be in % uh
at seven thirty , eight thirty and nine thirty % uh provided it is not raining .
okay .
% uh the other show , the fire show will be at eight o'clock and nine o'clock .
okay .
and that the fire show is located outside the park .
so once you get into the night safari , you have to buy the tickets .
okay .
and you enter in .
you can buy without the tram ride if you want to .
% uh but i would recommend that you take the tram % uh and the walk .
so % uh so we just gon na % um walk through the safari all our-
all by ourselves or do we have any guides there ?
okay .
in the tram ride , there will be a person a guide doing the commentary .
% uh what animals you are looking at .
but on the walk % uh you will be doing the walk by yourself .
get to see about % uh more than seventy per cent of the animals .
oh okay .
and the balance of thirty per cent , you will have to do the walk to see the rest of the show .
okay .
so % uh will there be any more % um sites , you know , there in night safari ?
% uh no more sites at the night safari
but in the day time -
we have the morning zoo which is next door .
% uh the morning zoo opens in the day .
and you will be seeing a lot of the mammals .
for example % uh the orang-utans , the chimpanzees .
that can only be seen in the day zoo but not in the night safari .
but % uh are we allowed to take pictures of them ?
% uh yes .
because the day zoo , it 's only open in the day and the day , you would n't require the flashlights , right ?
% uh yes .
but % uh during the night safari , we are allowed to take % um pictures but with no flash .
yes .
% uh yes .
you are allowed to take pictures of the animals without flash .
but if you are going to just take your friends and plants or the entrance area
% uh then it is fine with the flash .
okay .
okay .
alright .
so i think % uh we have covered-
% uh do you have like % uh you know % uh
more or less covered what you think you would like to do in singapore ?
% um well i think % uh we pretty much covered our two days trip in singapore % um .
and % uh we really are excited to go there .

yah , that could probably be it , yes .
and % uh , of course , tour around the whole of singapore
if it 's possible , yes .
yes , how many days are you intending to stay ?
oh , i 'm thinking maybe just a day or two .
a day or two ?
yes .
% uh that may be a bit short , you know ,
even for shopping .
it is ?
is it ?
yes .
% uh even for shopping it-
so % uh how long-
how many days do you think it would take someone like me , you know ,
% uh shopping in singapore ?
oh .
what sort of shopping are you thinking or what sort of items ?
mainly electronic items , yes .
oh , electronic .
% uh huh .
well , you talked about touring as well ,
so maybe you want to see some of our attractions ?
oh , sure , yes .
% uh huh .
% uh attractions , yes , i would love to , you know ,
visit those % uh famous places
at % uh most tourist
% uh most tourists visit , right .
but i have a question for , you know ,
since i would be planning on visiting % uh shops .
so-
what would be % uh the perfect place for an electronic shopper like me , in singapore ?
% uh i 'm losing you a little bit .
% uh , can you just say it-
oh .
yah .
sure .
can you hear me better now ?
yes , this is much better .
yes .
okay .
% uh my question was % uh for a person like me who likes electronic gadgets
what would be the perfect place % um , yah .
would be a perfect place for me to shop for gadgets ?
we have an it mall .
it mall , okay .
yah , it 's called funan centre .
and-
funan centre ?
yes , and it 's easily accessible .
okay , that 's wonderful .
and % uh when you say easily accessible
can i walk to that place or -
si~
depends on-
yah .
% uh where-
depends on where you 're staying .
oh , right .
% uh so-
% uh , i 've got a map here .
yah , i 've got a map here .
oh , you 've got a map , right .
thanks .
of where funan centre is .
and % uh it 's also near where we have old colonial buildings .
so you have the address there .
it says funan jewellery but do n't worry about it .
okay .
it 's % uh
it 's % uh-
it 's the same place .
so it 's % uh named differently
on google maps .
no , i think the jewellery shop maybe had something to do with this .
but it 's in that locality .
% ah okay .
so , yah .
i think i need-
i would need to % uh ask for more information for my travel .
% uh and then my % uh-
% uh where i would stay .
so let 's say my point of interest is the it mall and funan centre .
did i get that right ?
so if % uh that is my first destination
would be-
% ah okay .
% uh your voice quality is coming on and off .
% um i-
coming on and off ?
you-
% uh are you able now ?
this is much better .
% ah i 'm sorry .
this is better ?
% uh i 'm gon na give you the name of a hotel
% uh which is practically next door .
okay , just-
next door ?
yah .
and you can see-
% uh can you see it on the screen ?
% uh is it the peninsula plaza ?
wait .
% uh yes , that 's a shopping centre also .
wait , penins~
oh , yes .
oh , yes .
and you see coleman street is just % uh perpendicular to north bridge road .
% uh huh , yah .
i can see that , right .
so % uh it 's only how many metres or miles away ?
how many , yah .
how far is it from funan centre ?
yah .
% uh about five minutes , ten minutes if you walk fast .
% uh if you walks fast it 's five minutes .
oh , yah , i can see that on the map .
wow , that 's very near and-
but % uh i only have-
% ah i 'm sorry .
i only have a hundred-
no one thousand singaporean dollars .
it-
% uh your thousand singapore dollars is for your stay and your travel , right ?
% eh pretty much that , yes .
% uh huh .
so maybe che~
a cheaper hotel would be fine within the vicinity ,
within the area near the funan centre
that would be fine , yes .
che~
hum . % uh let me see .
hum . % uh let me see .
okay , sure .
take your time .
% uh just hold on a while .
do you mind staying in chinatown ?
chinato~
oh , well .
% hmm , i like the chinese culture but , % um % hm .
yah , this is a-
% eh your hotel -
% uh the funan centre is in fact within walking distance .
you sound like a young man .
% uh can i just ask what is your age range ?
no problem .
i am between twenty five and thirty .
okay , you can walk then .
% uh i just-
was found someone a hotel .
yes .
i 'm physically able .
you 're physically able ?
yes .
% uh we have many places that are also % uh accessible to people
who have difficulty walking .
% uh huh .
sure , okay .
i 'm gon na show you the hotels in chinatown .
sure .
just a minute .
okay .
% uh you were able to get it on the screen now ?
% hmm , yes , i can see the red letters .
i think those are the available hotels within the area .
yes .
yah , you can see on the left-hand side a list of the hotels ?
yes , the first one is chinatown hotel .
% uh % eh at twelve teck lim road ?
yah .
correct , yes .
yes , that 's a hundred and forty eight dollars .
but % uh-
per~
is that a day ?
per day ?
yes , a day .
okay , a hundred and forty eight .
not bad , i guess .
% uh does it come with-
i mean , will my stay be inclusive of a breakfast meal or something like that ?
i 'm not sure about that because-
anyway around there you can get a lot of % um food .
very reasonably priced food once you step out of the hotel .
if you want to be adventurous and try street food , chinese food
by which i think filipino food is quite close , right ?
i see .
% ah okay .
okay .
yes , i love chinese food
the chinese dishes too
so i do n't think i would have any problems with my % uh , you know ,
appetite needs , yes .
so-
okay , let me try this other one .
cheap hotels in sngapore .
okay .
% uh huh .
% uh no .
no , official shangri-la .
hundred and twenty five hotels .
there are cheaper hotels than that perhaps .
there you go .
can you see hundred and nineteen dollars ?
oh , that 's cheaper .
at least thirty dollars cheaper than the % uh chinatown hotel .
the first one you did show me earlier , right .
i guess that 's porcelain hotel it , can see that-
it's-
okay .
yes .
it 's a good location .
% ah okay .
so it 's centrally located ,
% uh it 's very accessible
i can see that from here , yes .
and a five-minute walk from chinatown mrt station .
okay .
yes , that 's right .
and you could walk to your-
funan mall .
you could take a bus
maybe two bus stops or one bus stop .
alright .
very nice .
oh , two bus stops .
so i ca n't walk from-
you can walk .
i think for a able-bodied young man you could walk .
% eh i can .
% uh i could
% hm but % uh how many minutes would it take me
if i walk from that hotel to my destination funan centre ?
maybe ten or fifteen minutes .
fifteen minutes slow walk , okay .
ten , fif~
okay .
not bad .
not bad .
you know what , i like walking
because it saves money .
and it 's good for your health , right ?
no , you get to see too , right ?
yah , exactly .
can-
because i 'm pretty sure that % uh given the chance this is gon na be my first time to visit singapore
i would prefer looking around and , you know ,
enjoying the sights , yes .
okay , there 's another hotel .
% uh , do you see it ?
yes .
% uh i can see the m hotel .
oh , no .
not yet .
oh % uh no not the e~
m and not the-
not m and not amara

santa~
ooh , okay .
and they 're more expensive too , yes .
i can see santa grand hotel

yes .
% uh lai chun yuen .
trengganu street , yes .
lai chun yuen , yah .
wow , that 's fifty five .
% uh it 's only fifty five dollars , yah .
that 's for just one stay i would assume .

try to find out what the-
this % uh hotel has to offer .
i know-
ooh , wow .

yes .
% uh it-
it is a converted % uh shophouse
so the buildings you saw were are the exterior .
they 're old buildings , heritage buildings , so the rooms are narrow .
you can see from the picture ?
right .
% uh , is it the-

there 's tea , coffee making , flat screen tv , cable channels , toiletries and hair dryer .
oh , okay .

% uh well , it does n't say ac but i think it should be .
i think it's-
oh .
yah .
it says air-conditioned-
i 'm sorry .
air-conditioned guest room .
sorry , yes .
% uh yes , that 's right .
the first word .
right .
% ah okay .
it does n't look bad .
i think it 's % uh okay for me as i 'll be travelling alone .
% hmm , yes .
yah , and then i do n't think i-
i 'll be staying in that room for , you know ,
more than an hour because i 'll be travelling in-
i think about-
and it also has wi-fi access so it 's very access friendly .
i can also use my phone , right ?
oh , okay .
right .
and how far is % uh this % uh hotel from % hm-
yah .
% uh could-
% uh i 'm losing you a little bit now .
oh , i mean-
can you hear me now ?
% uh yes .
better , okay .
% uh my question was , how far is this hotel from the funan centre ?
% uh like i said about ten minutes or-
oh , ten minutes , sorry .
% uh i get-
% uh slow walk fifteen minutes .
okay , not bad .
% uh alright .
so i got the hotel . i think % um i 'll % uh book a day for my stay here , right ?
so i got the hotel . i think % um i 'll % uh book a day for my stay here , right ?
this is a perfect % uh hotel for me-
for just me , yes .
at fifty-
at fifty five -
you said it 's fifty five , right ?
so-
yes , let me see here .
it was about-
you can put in a sixty dollars , you know .
it was about fif~
sixty , yes .
% uh just round it up .
yah , round it up .
just to be safe .
right , okay .
so sixty dollars a day stay at santa grand , got that .
oh-
hotel lai chun yuen .
% uh it is of i think % uh it used to be a chinese opera house
if they 're using the name it should be .
since they 're using the name , yah .
i-
i see .
so the building although-
% uh how long or how old do you think is the main infrastructure where the building itself ?
yah .
% uh the building-
original building is pre-war .
oh , huh , okay .
yah , pre-war but it-
they have all been % um given up by their original owners and restored completely
and in the case of the hotels they have been converted into hotels .
so what happens is sometimes they buy up a few units and join them up .
so-
i see .
i see .
and-
yah , so they-
that 's how they get you all the rooms % uh with a on suite bathroom .
yah , the original buildings had one bathroom at the back .
yah .
i see . okay .
i see . okay .
but i do n't think % uh that 's gon na be a problem now since it has been % uh remodelled or renovated , right ?
yes , that 's right .
not a problem at all .
not in singapore anyway .
that 's good .
okay , i know .
alright .
and the % um-
i 'm sorry , the customer reviews ?
yah , it says seven point five , you see ?
% uh in , yah .
yes .
yes .
which is good .
yes , it is .
alright .
and i think there 's no-
i have a place to stay , it 's very near % uh the location % uh funan centre .
it 's nothing this % um-
i do n't have any problems with food because you said that , you know ,
when you step out of the building-
% uh i 'm losing your voice now .
okay .
how about this time ?
yah , now it 's better .
what is happening over there ?
is your microphone falling off ?
% uh no .
actually my microphone is pretty much intact .
i 'm not sure why the audio is fluctuating .
% uh i 'm on-
% uh someone is assisting me now in the audio .
okay .
% uh huh .
okay .
what else % uh are you interested in ?
okay , so funan centre is a place for electronic gadgets , right ?
so i do n't think i would need more assistance about that .
i can % uh pretty much % uh do the shopping for myself .
but after that % um is there a museum nearby and how far is it % uh-
% uh there 's a new museum % uh about three or five minutes walk away
% uh and it 's the chinatown % uh heritage museum .
i do n't know if they have a website .
okay .
% uh let me list that down .
it is interesting because
% uh it shows you-
but these old buildings were used for long , long ago .
how people lived .
heritage muse~
i see .
% uh do you have a website for that i can % uh-
yah , i 'm trying to get it now .
okay , % hmm .
and then the museum % uh in the % uh features like the chinese history i would assume ?
% uh yes .
% uh not chinese history but the way of life in singapore .
oh , sorry .
right .
i 'm sorry , right .
thank you .
alright .
it 's okay .
let me see , huh .
heritage centre .
twenty-
and it 's just , you know ,
see , this is how the chinese arrived from china and it gives you a very good insight .
yes .
but the pictures-
the preview pictures are quite-
you see , these were the conditions .
okay .
% uh huh okay .
great history of ah ah kuoi
yah , they take personalities % uh who used to live in that area .
maybe not in the same room but they tell their story in there .
i see .
okay .
so you can connect the transformation from that kind of room to your hotel room .
i see .
i get it . % uh huh .
i get it . % uh huh .
same kind of-
% uh kind of building .
you know what i mean ?
oh , yah , i get it .
% um % hm okay .
so-
so it 's % uh-
sorry .
chinatown heritage centre , not museum , okay ?
heritage centre , yes .
and how much is the entrance % uh for this % uh museum or this place ?
let me see .
how much do i need to pay ?
yes .
i think ten dollars is more than enough .
it does n't say here .
accommodation , visitor information , right .
% uh it does n't give the price
but let me see , okay .
oh , there , ten dollars , i 'm right .
okay , spot on .
thanks .
alright .
so ten dollars for an adult like me
although i sound young .
alright .
an adult co~
an adult pass is ten dollars .
alright .
and-
yah .
and you see here % uh-
yes ?
sri mariamman temple ?
yes , i can see sri mariamman temple .
it 's within walking distance of your hotel .
wow , okay .
that 's pretty convenient .
i can walk there right and still i enjoy my travel just by walking , yes .
% hmm , and that it opens at nine a.m . to eight p.m . , okay .
yes .
yes , and-
so if you want to shop i suggest you-
the first one in the museum and then go to funan later .
the shops tend run a little bit later
at about ten o'clock .
% uh huh .
in the evening ?
no , in the morning .
in the morning ?
yes .
so i can visit this place first
and then while waiting for funan centre to open
and then i can visit funan centre after that , okay .
yah , that 's right .
so i have two destinations already .
% uh % um do you have an idea like
how many hours it would take me to tour the whole chinatown area to the centre ?
the museum itself .
the museum itself if you 're very interested about-
% uh maximum one hour i think .
an hour , okay .
hum .
or forty five minutes .
some people just rush through it because they 're not interested .
but if you really look at things
an hour would be more than enough .
yes .
i see , okay .
so the first i 'll be % uh visiting this place first
and then next stop is the funan centre .
and i have % uh some-
i have a list of things to buy so i do n't think-
and male shoppers just buy what they want right away .
yes .
you-
% uh i suggest you go round the shops and check the prices
and what accessories they give you .
and then you can tell them honestly you 're price checking so they give you good prices
and then you can decide where to buy from .
yes .
i see , okay .
alright .
so let 's say i-
i 'm done with funan centre but i did n't really like maybe , you know ,
% uh the prices there .
maybe i want the cheap because-
% uh is there any other places i can visit like-
similar % uh similar it malls ?
like that .
% uh it malls i think that 's the one i know of
because i shop there too .
% uh let me try .
% uh we have it fairs in singapore .
if you like crowded shopping you should come during the fair time .
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
and that time is when ?
okay , just a minute , huh .
so -
we just had one .
okay .
oh , the fair , right ?
yes , the fair .
does it happen often or maybe just % uh once a year or something ?
i think we have now about four times a year .
i see .
oh , i love fairs
most especially when it comes to things i 'm interested in like gadgets and stuff .
like that , right .
% ah yah .
so-
i 'm sorry .
while you 're looking for information we need
% uh in july
what kind of weather can i expect in singapore ?
% uh it can be very hot in singapore so bring very light clothing .
% hmm , very light clothing .
% uh how about-
do you have an estimate on maybe the temperature itself
like in farenheit or in centigrade ?
okay , centigrade about thirty three degrees .
wow , that 's hot .
% uh yah .
on a good cool day % uh if it rains maybe twenty eight , twenty nine .
but it will catch up to thirty two .
% ah okay .
okay , let 's , yah .
let 's talk about the temperature a little bit later .
so , yah .
do you have any other alternative shops for me ?
okay .
oh , yah .
let 's say , yah .
you mentioned the fair , sorry .
okay .
july , no , this one is electronic components .
we have-
no these are trade shows .
% um % hm trade show .
no , this is not it .
not a good choice .
it fairs ,
open fair .
i put in consumer .
okay .
i can see an expo there .
events , yes .
but i 'm not sure if those are electronic expos for consumers .
okay .
you can try comex , i think .
comex , alright .
comex .
yes , comex .
a comex large exhibition , % hm .
okay , this is in september though .
september , okay .
that 's okay .
well , i 'm pretty sure i can % uh buy , you know ,
whatever i need % uh in-
% uh at funan centre so that 's fine .
but i'll-
so what-
this one 's over .
% uh huh .
yah .
this one-
% uh if you have a look at this one , comex is held
at suntec city which is another convention centre
but they turned the hall into a big shopping area .
oh .
% uh wow .
so maybe when there 's no fair or expo going on
% uh you can expect % uh lots of things that you can buy ,
electronic stuff ?
% uh no .
% uh when they just-
there is a fair it is a specific fair .
so if it 'll be a furniture fair or a food fair or a-
okay .
okay .
i see .
oh , so the-
at that place is not exclusive for electronic shows and things like-
no .
% uh let me-
do you want to get into here ?
alright .
okay .
% um comex and it show , okay .
are you able to read it ?
yes , it says comex and the it show .
what gadgets did you-
gadgets , % hm .
get , okay , during the it show ?
alright .
okay , may-
i 'll % uh-
but that is september , right ?
is that right ?
yes , it-
but % um the show was held in september of last year though .
% um let 's see-
yah , so usually it will be around that time .
around that time .
you see in march we just had an it show ?
oh , so i missed it .
yah , i missed it , % hm .
but we have four .
i think september is one of the ones .
i see , okay , yah .
okay , oh , , % uh , remember this kind of % uh expo then , the
comex and the it show and i believe , yah .
it 's % uh available on facebook
i can keep track of their % uh-
their activities , yes , okay .
so that 's settled then , % hmm .
so that-
anything else you would like to buy in singapore or see ?
i love electronics but mainly-
what else ?
i have a question about the weather again though .
okay .
thirty three degrees % uh celcius or centigrade % uh can be hot
but it 's % uh similar to % uh what we experience here in my country
during the summer season .
that 's what % uh-
yes , that 's right .
% uh that 's not % uh really a problem for me .
% uh so i have two destinations
% uh funan centre and possibly % uh the convention centre where co~
the comex and it show are held .
yah , that's-
if it 's on .
yes .
but there-
if there is no % uh expo going on then it 's gon na be % uh like a mall , right ?
% uh yes , there are shops -
there are lots of shops there , you know ,
to buy clothings , % uh , fashion , other items .
and if-
shops .
mainly for clothing , % um % hm .
yah , if you want buy-
% uh let me go to-
if you want to buy cameras-
are you interested in cameras ?
oh , my brother is so i think , you know ,
i can % uh add to my shopping list % uh maybe a few camera peripherals and attachments .
yes .
okay .
peninsula shopping centre has many % uh shops selling cameras .
there are different shops .
so again check out the prices there .
% uh i 'm trying to get the shopping centre for you here .
okay .
% uh huh okay .
wait % uh .
and it 's also near to chinatown .
you could walk or take a bus .
two bus stops away .
% uh huh i 'll take note of that , yes .
and % uh if it 's near chinatown i can-
it 's near my hotel .
% uh sa~
it 's near santa grand hotel , yes .
yah .
yes .
yes , you see it 's north bridge road .
% uh chinatown is in south bridge road area
just separated by the river
and you walk a little bit and you 'll reach peninsula plaza .
and you can also eat there and then you can walk to the shops but they haven't-
the camera shops have n't put themselves online .
% uh huh north bridge road .
i see .
right .
i see , okay .
i love chinese food .
okay , when it comes to food
do you have % uh anything listed about filipino restaurants near the area ?
% uh if you come in-
on a weekend and you want to meet filipinos and eat filipino food
you go to what we called little filipino -
little philippines .
% uh it 's actually lucky plaza .
that 's where all the filipinos congregate
and so on the fourth and fifth floors % uh we have what si~
shops serving just filipinos .
lucky~
but it 's not actually a place
it 's more of an event like it happens-
it's-
no , it 's a shopping centre .
a very old one down in orchard road which is the shopping area .
are you getting it on your screen ?
yes , i can see lucky plaza when the there 's a map , yes .
and there are buses from chinatown to orchard road
so if you come and you include a sunday on your visit
on sunday you go up there and you 'll see lots of filipinos
you can get perhaps a better variety of filipino food
because sunday is when-
well are assumed to be off work , yes .
i see .
well , sunday .
oh , i 'll take note of that .
sunday and-
is there a particular time or just during that the whole day ?
sunday ?
% uh the whole day you can get lunch , dinner there
but you want to eat filipino food in singapore .
% eh yah .
but , yah .
maybe , you know , if-
ever i get homesick-
just for the day . it 's for-
just for the day . it 's for-
% uh i believe there 's a stall at the airport also run by a filipino .
oh , yah .
% uh i ca n't remember at which
it 's actually at the place where % uh the staff eat .
it 's a staff canteen but you can go there and i used to eat there , filipino food .
okay .
% uh huh .
% uh it 's a trivia for me .
alright .
% hm if i go-
if i 'm including sunday in my travel list is-
i 'll also go to church -
% uh the christian church .
is there a christian church nearby ?
% uh which % uh-
is it catholic or % uh-
just christian .
christian ?
like-
it can be baptist but , yah .
not really catholic but christian -
i think there 's a new life christian centre % uh in singapore .
new life christian centre , yes .
i heard of new life .
wait , huh .
new life .
is it called christian-
i am not sure , i 'm sorry .
yah , christian centre or-
the biggest here in the philippines % uh we do have that in several sites as well
accross the country .
okay .
i put in singapore and i 'll try and get you the address .
that i-
okay .
okay , we have new life community church .
i see .
christian .
can you recognise which one is affiliated to your church ?
% hm it should be new life vineyard church .
i 'm not sure , % hm .
oh .
maybe you can check that ,
the vineyard church one .
yah .
% uh that is an interesting part of singapore also .
you can do some tasting of chinese food -
oh .
% uh there .
and if i 'm not mistaken there 's also a filipino restaurant there
% uh because i was there recently and i passed it .
% ah okay .
i see .
% hm is this a church now ?
brunch gathering-
okay , yes , it is christian .
and does it , is it % uh nearby or do i have to travel by bus ?
% uh no .
this one you need to take a bus
% uh because the trains do n't go exactly there .
but it 's an interesting quarter of singapore .
really ?
okay .
then maybe % uh there are lot of sights to see , i guess .
yes .
yes , % um there are food especially to try .
a blend of chinese and malay food
and as i said there is a filipino % uh like a café there -
okay .
yah , okay .
nearby .
alright .
sunday i got , alright .
this is new life vineyard church .
so-
yah , and it 's at one eight three east coast road .
church .
alright , got it .
and % uh how many minutes of % uh travel by bus -
do you think ?
% uh huh let me see .
number ten east west
number thirty two .
% um you see the instructions at the bottom here ?
yes , one eight three-
% uh with an arrow .
% uh huh .
we 're directly opposite the ocbc bank .
op~
yah , i think allow yourself forty five minutes .
oh , so that 's a bit too far , i guess .
that 's good-
that 's okay .
oh , by the way-
but it 's fun to go .
it 's interesting place .
yes .
i 'll keep that in mind .
i 'm listing all of the % uh places that i 've asked about % uh
from the start of our conversation here , okay , % hm .
alright .
forty five minutes so if this-
i 've i missed the first service it 's about thirty , okay , yah .
let-
just a minute .
let me get the-
what is the services .
okay , it 's at eleven thirty a.m .
% uh huh okay .
so i need to-
i need to be on the bus at ten thirty , i guess .
yes , to be safe .
because on sundays it 's off peak for public transport .
to be safe .
oh , yah .
how is the traffic in % uh singapore on sundays ?
is it-
% uh the buses % uh do n't come as frequently as they do
during % uh office days and of peak hours .
peak hours they send many more buses in the early mornings and in the evenings
when people are going to work and coming back .
i mean i have-
great .
i see .
so that is why you need to allow time .
but then on the trains it 's only about four minutes or five minutes off peak the most .
usually-
i see .
usually about three minutes .
three minutes .
but % uh does the traffic get pretty congested on sundays or not really ?
no .
that 's good .
it's-
yah , it 's more relaxing on sundays .
oh , okay .
so the forty five-minute travel time by bus
is pretty much % uh smooth ride without-
yes , smooth , yah .
traffic jams and things like that ?
okay .
so the farthest place so far in my online list is the church .
% hmm , okay , new life vineyard church .
you could go all the way north and visit the night safari if you want .
the night~
or-
but what kind of place is that , jeanne ?
% uh it 's a night zoo .
% ah okay .
like all of it the nocturnal animals can be viewed there , right ?
yes , that 's right .
say what are your interest back in philippines ?
what do you like to do ?
% hm i love-
mainly i love those geek stuff i mentioned earlier .
i love geek stuff but i also like travelling .
% hm like i 'm interested in beaches as well but not like , you know ,
my friends here they are very much % uh into % uh beaches and stuff , like that .
but is there a beach somewhere ?
beach just to swim , right ?
it 's % uh-
or-
% hmm , yes .
to relax and , you know ,
enjoy the sun .
i know it can get very hot in july , right ?
% uh sentosa siloso beach .
okay , i 'm gon na get you a beach in sentosa island .
and how far is that from my hotel do you think ?
from your hotel you could go by train and then i 'll get to the train section a little bit later .
okay .
% uh , yah .
i do n't think % uh , you know ,
my destinations can be % uh visited in just one day .
% uh exactly .
% uh or-
right .
okay , i can see the website from here .
siloso beach .
siloso , is that % um a singaporean term for something ?
% uh we were told it 's a filipino term for jealousy .
is that right ?
yes , it is .
so it is correct , huh ?
yes , it is correct .
% uh i do n't know ho~
but is the owner filipino by any chance ?
% uh no .
siloso is just the name of this stretch of the beach on sentosa .
just a name .
i see , okay .
and you could swim there .
there are beach shelters .
you can eat there , you know ,
% uh there are bistros you could-
there are also like ice cream parlors .
things like that .
wow , okay .
and-
and we have beach parties also sometimes .
in siloso beach -
at siloso beach ?
yes , siloso , yes .
or tanjong .
there 's another beach called tanjong beach .
tanjong beach .
% uh on sentosa .
% uh sentosa island has attractions also
but this is just the beach area i 'm showing you .
okay , thank .
that 's right , % um % hm .
wait % uh let 's % uh-
no % uh let me see .
okay .
okay , yah .
they 're both very good .
% uh huh okay .
you see , on the island they have free bus service to bring you
so you could go to both beaches .
% uh the free buses is wonderful .
okay .
yah .
and you can take-
let me get on the mrt for sentosa .
okay .
just a minute , yah .
okay .
this is our mass rapid transit system .
okay , i can see the map , right .
so you come in here .
are you following my mouse ?
see at changi airport ?
yah , changi airport .
yah , and you can go all the way down here .
it 's the east-west line .
east-west line .
and you-
and you can connect down to % uh raffles place .
raffles place .
or-
you can connect down to-
sorry .
city hall .
okay .
and then you change to go to dhoby ghaut
% uh which is a major interchange
and then you take another train you 're down right into chinatown .
i see .
% ah okay , i got it .
so chi~
huh , so how about the travel duration ?
how many minutes would it take me from the beach to the chinatown ?
beach to chinatown , okay .
sentosa island is here .
can you see harbourfront ?
yes , i can see harbourfront .
so from chinatown you just take a train to harbourfront .
oh , i guess % uh the travel time is pretty quick .
yes % uh-
not really a big deal .
including walking up and down the steps and everything
maybe twenty minutes .
the ride itself would be-
maybe five minutes , you know .
two and a half minutes , very short .
and then here you take a shuttle into sentosa
which is at the bus station within walking distance .
you walk about five minutes
and where the public buses stop you can take a sentosa bus in for one dollar .
five minutes .
i see .
% ah okay .
% uh huh okay .
you know , what i 'm curious .
i 've never been to singapore and thank you for giving me all these wonderful travel destinations .
i 'm just curious 'cause i 've never been there .
% uh the navigation
is it easy like i can just read bulletin boards and street signs in english ? are
is it easy like i can just read bulletin boards and street signs in english ? are
all of them are in english , right ?
% um hmm .
yes % uh the bus stops have the entire route for-
not the entire route but the route of the buses where they 're going to go .
you just-
if you 're taking a public bus you just need to be on the correct side of the road
so you can ask anybody at the bus stop .
they 'll be able to tell you .
bus stop .
and % uh when you are at the airport
go down to the mrt station and buy a card .
% uh you need to pay a small deposit .
i think it 's about ten dollars or seven dollars
which you get back % uh when you go back home .
and maybe there 's a small charge for making the card , you know ,
just a nominal fee .
but the deposit-
you put extra deposit is for your travel fare
so you do n't have to worry about carrying the correct amount of money .
okay .
okay .
wow .
% ah okay , i see .
and i 'm pretty sure-
% uh is it safe to assume that my lo~
my credit card will be accepted in most of the merchants or shops there in singapore ?
% uh yes .
at the it shops % uh i think they would accept .
at the major stores they would accept , yes .
if you pay it on the streets in chinatown
if you buy souvenir say three souvenirs for ten dollars then they would not accept .
% uh i need cash , yes .
yah , you need some cash .
you might want to change it when you arrive at the airport .
the rates are quite decent .
right , okay .
so-
that -
if you are staying just two days there 's no point hunting for a money changer
who usually gives a slightly better rate .
and , yah .
thanks .
and the-
i can do money changing at the airport ?
is it-
yes .
possible there ?
okay .
yes , you can change at the airport
and then go to the basement where the mrts
which stands for mass rapid transit .
% uh get your travel card .
so once you 've got your local money you can buy your travel card
and they will supply you a map .
at least they used to a map and they can both also be very informative .
% uh huh .
i see .
% ah okay .
about how to travel , you know ,
if you 're not sure there they will give you very good directions .
alright .
now , i think i have a few more questions . i have asked for the funan centre , the museum , the beach .
now , i think i have a few more questions . i have asked for the funan centre , the museum , the beach .
any-
% uh do you have any recommendations on
% uh like natural scenic spots in singapore like that , know ,
things like that .
nature-related ~
nature-re~
% uh related .
one of my best % uh places is this place
and you should bring your binoculars if you 're going .
% uh huh okay .
i think % uh that here .
pertains to the map .
nature-
but there are also places that you can just do a walk .
% uh this one you have to travel
because it 's in the north and you are in the south of singapore .
ooh .
it 's gon na be pretty far i believe .
so is it sungei buloh wetlands museum ?
yes , sungei buloh .
it means bamboo river .
sungei is a bamboo and buloh ?
no sungei is a river and buloh is river .
% uh huh .
% uh sorry .
buloh is bamboo and-
so river bamboo .
oh .
buloh-
river % uh i get it .
and it 's a wetland reserve ?
yah .
if you go at low tide or even high tide you can see mudskipper -
% uh you can see a % uh tree climbing crabs .
if you come in december you can see migratory birds .
% uh huh migratory birds , sorry .
% uh that fly from % um % uh-
as far away as mongolia and some continue to perth .
now , let me see .
you can take a train up to kranji .
kranji is where it 's located .
% uh huh okay .
and then you take this bus called the kranji express .
can you see this ?
kranji .
yes , i can see a timetable .
a schedule .
yah .
so at the kranji when you get out of the train you come out on the road
you wait for this bus and you pay him three dollars for a two-way transfer .
he 'll give you a ticket .
% uh huh two-way transport .
so-
yah .
so when you 're at sungei buloh check out the times that they leave sungei buloh back to the station so you can time yourself on your walk .
kranji .
% uh huh .
okay , i got that .
thanks .
so i have nick~
% uh sungei-
how do you pronounce that sungei ?
buloh~
sungei buloh .
sungei buloh .
wet~
wetland reserve .
then-
or you can continue on the bus and just visit other places .
this is just some of them that he will drop you .
% uh it 's a gardenasia .
i think it 's a nursery .
okay .
% uh bollywood is also nursery .
hay dairies they have got goats from all over the world .
% uh and the-
like the whole place this % uh sungei buloh wetland reserve
is it like an open space or like wildness~
yes .
okay , it is .
that 's nice .
% uh if you want to watch migratory birds in december then-
oh anyway from september to march then you need like half a day or one day there .
% uh because i need to wait for the birds to mi~
to do the migrating thing , right ?
i guess .
no .
% uh they will be there
but the thing is you might enjoy it and walk around
and there are trails over the % uh marine life and trails over % uh ponds % uh in there .
so if you 're a birder , a twitter , they may normally spend half a day there .
i see .
alright .
but if you just want to see
then you can continue on the bus and visit the rest of the places .
% uh huh , okay .
wow , wonderful .
so i have lots of destinations .
i already have lots of destinations here listed .
% uh my favourite would be , of course , % uh funan centre
and % uh maybe the beach , yes .
i 'm gon na -
i have to check that out .
alright .
any other recommendations ?
% uh we have attractions % uh if you want like the bird park .
the bird park ?
yes .
bird park .
bird~
we have the jurong bird park .
if you are lazy to % uh look at birds , you know ,
through your binoculars you want them in your face-
okay .
jurong bird park .
i do n't think i would love birds on my face though but it 's okay .
and you can see them-
there you can have them flying right in front of you .
like very close to me .
okay .
this one 's nice .
well i 've always been % uh fascinated with birds -
% uh fascinated by the , you know ,
wildlife , right .
yah .
so this one is nice .
so-
% uh this one is not so wild
because it 's an attraction
but sungei buloh is wild .
it 's re~
oh , yah .
okay .
let me take note of that .
there you go .
alright .
very nice .
alright .
if you want more information on wild places
% uh you-
when you come in to singapore you might want to contact someone from
% uh nature society
and we have nature guides there .
so-
or they-
i see .
they are the more hardcore people , you know .
the more-
what do you call them ?
hardcore .
you want to-
% ah sorry .
really wild % uh-
lord heart .
like an organisation , right .
% uh it 's a-
yes , but there are guides in there that can help you .
i see .
or like
you can see horseshoe crab .
so just remember this % uh website when you come and see .
and there are public walks that you can join .
public walks , huh .
oh , i can see the website .
it 's a nature society , right ?
yah .
yes .
very nice .
so the-
this is focused on wilderness
whereas places like the zoo and the bird park is more attractive , you know ,
for tourists who do n't want to get too muddy or dirty or-
okay .
of % um-
alright .
well for-
% uh any other tips when i'm-
while i 'm in singapore like % um-
are there any % uh how do i say this ?
% hm guidelines , things that i should not do on the streets , you know .
things like-
% uh you should walk % uh at traffic light junctions and , you know ,
you should walk carefully .
do n't jaywalk .
okay .
% uh it 's actually for your own safety
because the traffic can be , you know ,
% uh they follow traffic rules but people are used to people not walking when the lights are red
so you should just follow the rules there .
% uh not to litter .
i see .
yah .
oh , okay , not to litter .
yes .
% uh yah , you can bring in gum to chew if you need to chew gum
but just do n't bring in great quantities
because you 're not allowed to import chewing gum .
ooh .
% ah really ?
% uh you can chew it but you ca n't import it
because if you stick the gum in the wrong place you can stop the trains from moving .
you know what i mean ?
okay , i get it .
% uh huh .
that 's why we have the rule
because % uh if there 's no total contact the doors do n't shut properly the trains get stuck .
ooh , yes .
so we ca n't afford to have people chewing gum .
i see .
also dirtying the place .
yah .
is it okay to like , you know ,
use my camera and just take pictures of people and , you know ,
random places or is there a regulation-
some kind of regulation about my camera use ?
if you 're in a place of worship % uh it 's better not to photograph people .
% uh and maybe you want to ask the temple people before you do the photographing .
if you 're photographing the architecture like the statues % uh the facade that's-
worship , places of worship , okay .
place of worship .
yes ?
quite alright .
yah , that's-
that 's okay .
that 's okay .
and in the airport i do n't think they want you to use your camera .
yes , i do n't think so too .
alright .
i 'm just curious about-
since you mentioned temple
what is the % uh common religion in singapore ?
we have all religions in singapore
% uh but % um as the majority three quarters of us are chinese .
the buddhism and taoism is very % uh visible in singapore .
in fact , within walking distance of your hotel there is a fairly new buddhist temple and it 's huge .
oh , yah .
at the what-
that 's something that i would like to visit ,
the temples .
any nearby temples ?
% uh i propose you visit another one that is further away .
% uh you can walk too but it 's not so near as this new temple .
maybe the oldest temple .
yes .
i love old buildings .
that 's % uh-
this one .
okay , here it is .
telok ayer street is just one street away from where you are .
oh , it 's very near .
quite near , right .
wow , i love that infrastructure right there .
what do you call that building ?
how do you like % uh-
it's-
thian hock keng .
% uh huh .
but is there a-
like % uh a more common noun name for it ?
% uh that 's what we call it .
unfortunately , the street name is also-
this name is chinese dialect .
the street name is telok ayer street
which is-
telok ayer street ?
yah , which is water bay street .
can you see here ?
it means water bay street .
% uh huh .
oh , oldest most singaporean tem~
i can see like a temple over~
the temple overview , yes .
yes .
and % uh if you go there you allow some time to visit % uh mosque , % hm-
two doors away from it .
it 's just been newly renovated again
but it 's about as old as this temple .
i see .
this temple actually dates from the eighteen twenties
when it was a little shrine .
so it 's one of the oldest in singapore .
and % uh are there monks there now ?
i mean , you know ,
like i get to see them-
% uh no .
i 'm afraid it 's a bit more like a tourist attraction
except on feast days .
oh , okay .
% uh the one way you get to see a lot of monks
is the one very near % uh buddha tooth relic .
buddha tooth relic .
this is also a good-
buddha tooth relic .
this one is strictly buddhist .
strictly , yes .
buddha tooth relic , % uh .
yah .
thian hock keng is a buddhist and taoist
so you get a lot of other deities that are common to both religions
but here you get mostly buddha .
and they can not -
but
this is south bridge road .
yes , sorry ?
right .
i-
i 'm sorry but i can not take pictures of those deities , right ?
no ?
% uh i think you ask whoever looks like a monk in there first before you take the photograph .
i see .
yah , so as not to offend them , it would be a bit better .
oh .
i see .
but also what you 're trying to say is that
there 's a chance that they would allow you to do that or-
yes , they might if you look very obviously like a tourist .
you know , is it -
i hope i would look like a-
very much like a tourist to them when i visit there .
okay .
so they would allow-
can i show you the-
these photos here ?
yes , okay .
okay .
there it is .
wow .
so this is grander looking .
it 's new % uh , you see ?
so this is the most recent photograph of this building , is it ?
yes .
this one is just a few years old but the other one it has been restored
but % uh the last time i went about a month ago they are still restoring parts of it
so maybe the back you ca n't go .
okay .
and % uh , yes .
this is the buddha tooth relic .
and you can go inside this building or maybe-
yes , you can go inside .
% uh make sure you use the side door .
the there are doors in the centre and doors to the left and right of the centre .
use the side doors .
just-
side doors ?
yah , the main door is for the temple priest to go in .
i see .
oh .
there's-
there 's another one .
% uh that is-
this one is also in chinatown
and it 's a heritage temple .
right .
and do these temples or , you know ,
tourist temple attractions % uh ask for entrance fees and % uh things like that ?
do they ask you for , you know ,
like a ticket-
okay .
no .
regular museum does ?
no , okay .
no , but-
so that is for free .
no .
% uh but here the tem~
% uh the sri mariamman if you use your camera inside they 'll ask you for a camera fees .
just a few dollars .
wow .
% ah okay .
wow , this % eh-
are those , % uh , statues of people ?
here they are .
wow .
the those are statues so it 's very spectacular for % uh photography .
yah .
very colourful % uh .
it 's very interesting .
wow .
it 's hindu .
this is hindu .
you see this picture here ?
i love that .
yes , i can see the pictures .
hindu .
and this is very-
% uh this is-
has a very authentic view because people are still % uh praying here
they 're worshiping here so you should go in the morning before twelve .
oh .
morning before twelve .
why ?
yes .
they close from about twelve to about four , four thirty .
they have a short break
and then they re-open in the evening .
so either that or you go in the evening .
ooh .
so before twelve they should come to this place bef~
yes , if you want to use your camera you get better light also .
i see .
and they 're closed between twelve and four ?
% uh they have a small door open you can get in
but inside there 's no activity , there 's nobody praying , you know ,
it's-
the temple priests are not around .
i see .
okay , wow .
so this is another destination for me .
the temples are very interesting
and they 're very % uh perfect for , you know ,
% uh camera enthusiasts and photos and things like-
yah .
right .
okay , very nice .
right .
okay .
okay .
oh , i see i have-
well , you-
anything else ?
well , % um i think % uh that would be all .
you 've been very helpful and informative .
i 've learnt a lot about , you know ,
different things and i 'm pretty sure there are a lot of other places to visit % uh given the chance .
but % uh as for now i think % uh , okay .
i 'm losing you .
oh , i mean for now-
% uh huh .
can you hear me ?
yes .
now it 's better .
alright .
i mean thank you for these wonderful information .
i 've learnt a lot .
but for now i think i 'm all good .

% uh good afternoon .

lynnette here .
yah .
hi lynnette this is participant number eleven .
and can i have your name please ?
yah .
yah , this is participant number eleven .
okay , and how can i help you ?
yah i 'm planning to have % um-
to go around asia and singapore is at the top of my list .
and what attractions can i go in singapore ?
okay .
% uh which part of the year are you planning to come ?
% um maybe this % um last week of may .
this year .
okay .
and how many people are coming with you ?
% um couple of my friends .
okay and ha-
% uh okay , what do you and your friends like to do ?
% um for me , i like to know about the culture , history and of course historical places in singapore .
% uh sorry , i did n't get you .
the last one , what did you say ?
% um it 's the historical places in singapore .
i 'm sorry for that .
okay .
so % uh you like to see culture , history -
yah .
and % uh places ?
pla-
yes , that 's right .
places ?
yes .
okay .
okay , so % uh for the culture-wise .
singapore has a few culture .
so we have like the chinese culture .
yah .
yes .
% hm lynnette , i have a question
because % um i was kinda-
yes ?
yes lynnette ?
% uh yes .
for the culture side , we have % uh the chinese culture .
we have the malay .
arab culture .
we also have the indian culture .
so which one should i introduce you first ?
i think the chinese culture .
the chinese culture .
yes .
okay .
i would like to introduce you to the chinatown % uh of singapore .
yes ?
yes .
okay , i 'm just going to show you , this is just one picture of chinatown .
yes and are there a lot of souvenirs in chinatown in singapore ?
% ah yes .
there are souvenirs available but they will be all % uh chinese related kind of souvenir .
so this is just one street scene in chinatown .
alright .
yes .
i 'm going to show you .
yah , this is just a street scene in chinatown .
and then when the people in the past come to singapore .
% uh they all live near the singapore river .
so chinatown is actually just next to the singapore river .
their houses , you could see are more elaborate .
they have % uh these carvings .
alright , some of these houses have carvings outside their houses .
% uh and it will be a little bit different from the other culture .
% hm yes .
% uh so-
alright .
the houses in the chinatown , how-
what year they were built ?
okay .
more-
most of these chinatown houses , i would say they are in the range of about
a hundred twenty years now .
like
again wow .
i see .
they were-
yah , they we 're built in the early nineteen hundreds .
so the different-
and the chinese are also divided into various dialect speaking .
% hm would it be the mandarin one or
% hm the two-
what 's this ?
the chinese dialects ?
okay .
dialects are spoken languages .
i see .
yah .
% uh languages will be both spoken and written .
so % uh dialect meaning it 's just spoken language .
so this people , they came from china and they live in % uh various so-called % uh provinces in china .
and they speak different dialect .
so when they come here % uh not every one of them would speak mandarin .
yah .
so they will still be just speaking in their % uh dialects .
i see .
i got it .
alright .
so when they came here , they still live in different street % uh in singapore .
% hm i have a question .
is chinatown the-
one of the most visited places ?
% uh i would say it 's a popular spot for tourist to visit .
if you want to learn , to see the chinese % um houses .
yes .
% uh where do the chinese % uh used to live % uh in the past .
and there are some pictures on your right-hand side .
these are just some old photograph of % uh chinatown .
yes .
yes , is that % hm a horse or-
what 's this ?
the one in the street .
okay . this is actually % uh a bullock cart .
okay . this is actually % uh a bullock cart .
yah , in the past , they do n't have % uh motor vehicles .
motor vehicles came later part of the years .
so they started using bullock cart to transport their goods .
% uh and % uh yah , mainly for transportation of goods .
oh yes .
for people , they would be using the trishaws .
it 's a three-wheel vehicle .
% uh yes .
% uh so this is the scene % uh what you can see in chinatown .
and you also mentioned about history , right ?
yes .
okay .
% uh do you want me to introduce you to % uh a museum in chinatown ?
yah .
okay .
that would be fine .
okay .
we have a museum in chinatown and % uh this museum is called the chinatown heritage centre .
yes , are there-
is there a show in that heritage centre ?
% uh there is no show but there are some % uh tv programmes that you can stop to see .
it is not a very big museum .
% hm so-
% uh so-
% uh i see .
so there are no cultural shows ?
okay , so-
% uh no culture show for this % uh museum .
it is housed inside a shop house .
okay .
i see .
okay , so you can see the layout of the first level .
yes .
okay .
and the second level .
yup .
okay , and the third level .
so it 's a three level building .
alright .
yes .
there are no escalators .
there 's only a lift but the lift is quite small .
that 's fine .
yah .
so you are young , right ?
so you should be okay .
yup .
so it 's accessible by the mrt .
% uh huh .
okay .
so these are just some of the things that you 'll be looking at inside the % uh-
% uh inside the % uh museum .
so % um yes , lynnette , % um i have a question .
okay .
yes .
% um because % uh singapore is neighbouring malaysia , indonesia , thailand .
% hm i want to know who are the ancestors of singaporeans .
% uh ancestors of singaporeans .
yes .
okay .
% uh in the beginning % uh there were actually some native singaporeans who live here .
yes .
alright .
% uh there were about thousand of them .
and % uh we do have % uh-
back in the past , we were actually part of the mahajapit
forces based in indonesia .
% uh mahajan people .
yes .
yes .
and % uh well , things were going fine .
we had kings to rule us .
they were about five of them .
kings in singapore ?
% uh kings , yes .
there were kings in singapore .
alright .
% uh the first king of singapore is called sang nila utama .
sang nila utama .
yes .
and he % uh named us singapura from temasek he renamed us as singapura
% uh and that 's how singapore gets its name .
alright .
now the last king of singapore , because he was pursued by his % uh enemies .
and he went over to melaka setup and other kingdom there .
so we do not have any more kings here .
alright .
and so it was pretty quiet out here again
until the year of eighteen nineteen when raffles came to singapore .
so when he came here , we have approximately about a thousand people living here .
yes , who is raffles ?
it 's the-
% uh raffles is from % uh britain .
% uh brittanian % uh so-
yes , he 's a european .
% uh yah .
so he came here because he was % uh working for the british east india company .
% uh so-
yes .
alright .
now , when he came here , later on he decided to make singapore into a free port .
so from then on , many people from all over the world started to come here .
% uh for trades and business ?
yes , for trade and business .
and to seek for employment as well .
yup .
% uh so there are people from all over the world coming here .
yes .
for example , we have people from the nearby malay archipelago area .
what 's malay archipelago area ?
what 's % hm-
what country is that ?
okay .
so the malay archipelago , we will be talking about the indonesian % uh islands .
% uh indonesia .
i see .
alright .
we are talking about % uh malaysia .
yah .
yes .
malaya at that time .
% uh we are % uh-
so basically nearby to singapore , we call this the malay archipelago .
malay archipela-
yah .
and we also have people coming from china .
alright .
yes .
we also have people coming from europe .
yes .
and we have people coming from the arab countries .
yes , so-
so the main group of people would be from these countries .
yah .
% uh so it 's a mix of races .
% uh yes .
% um yes .
so singapore is now multi-racial .
and-
because of our history .
yes .
i 'll look at that .
yes .
% hm i saw here that you have a relic temple .
okay .
% uh buddha relic temple ?
yes .
okay .
that is in chinatown .
% uh that 's in chinatown ?
yes .
so there are a lot of things to do in chinatown .
% uh the buddha relic temple is just located in chinatown .
and you could do those temple when you are going down to chinatown .
alright .
so i 'm going to show you again the image of the buddha relic temple .
yes .
yes , so % uh lynnette , i have a question .
so we can walk through the-
through chinatown and through this % um other attractions from another to-
from other attraction to-
for example chinatown and it 's neighbouring attractions .
% uh yes .
this is all % uh built % uh just in chinatown itself .
chinatown has a few lanes .
alright , it 's not just one street .
so it 's actually consists of quite a number of lanes .
% uh and one of the attractions % uh you are thinking of visiting is this buddha relic temple .
yah , that 's nice .
you can walk inside but there is a dress code .
% uh dress code .
so what 's the dress code ?
% uh dress code , you will have to be appropriately dressed .
for example % uh no like shorts .
cute like i mean , sorry , % uh cargo pants % uh just will be fine .
% uh singlet of course is not appropriate % uh dress code for % uh visiting any places of worship here .
yes .
% hm are there a lot of people worship in that temple ?
oh yes .
there are local people who goes in % uh to do their prayers % uh during the opening hours of the temple .
% uh so % uh you will see , yes , worshippers going in to worship .
but otherwise % uh most of the time in % uh chinese temples % uh it will be more crowded when % uh-
like on special days .
% uh the first day and the fifteenth day of the chinese calendar which is different from the western calendar .
yes .
yes .
okay .
and of course during the buddha .
% uh the buddha % uh birthday .
yes , you will find that % uh more people would be worshiping
% uh otherwise it 's % uh-
well that is-
it 's not that crowded to visit the buddha relic temple .
yes .
% hm so it 's quite a walk when i go around chinatown % hm .
would-
can i-
yes .
quite a walk .
% uh if you are thinking of taking the mrt , it is just about three lanes away .
yah .
yah but it 's okay .
okay then .
yes .
yes .
so % uh i think % uh it again depends on whether you want to visit % um
% uh it 's it all depends whether you want to visit the chinatown heritage centre .
if you were planning to do that , then you have to allocate about one hour in the-
at chinatown heritage centre or minimum forty minutes i would say .
% uh so forty minutes .
the buddha relic temple approximately % uh twenty minutes .
yah .
yes .
% uh walk through some of the lanes probably would take you about % uh one and a half hours .
yes .
so well , you can spend easily half a day just doing % uh these few places .
so i can go around for half a day
and visit all the places in chinatown .
yes .
yes , that 's right .
% hm beca-
so do you want to eat some % uh chinese food in chinatown ?
yes .
okay .
do you want to go to a restaurant ?
yup .
or you want to do just % uh non-air conditioned food places ?
% hm how about the restaurant ?
sorry .
restaurants ?
how-
yes .
how about in a restaurant ?
okay .
% uh do you know this food called chinese dim sum ?
% hm yes .
okay .
chinese dim sum .
yah .
so these are just some % uh like % uh small little food and they normally steam them in a bamboo container .
otherwise you-
there are also some dishes that is fried .
% uh so that would be something that you can get % uh in chinatown .
alright , chinese dim sum in-
yes .
chinatown huh .
and-
yes .
yes , and also % uh lynnette .
% hm what about the night life in singapore ?
how-

from this club ?
okay .
alright .
now , you will have to % uh take a mrt .
yah .
alright .
and the closest mrt stop for you would be at this station called the % uh tiong bahru mrt train station .
tiong bahru mrt station .
yes .
% uh this is on the west line .
so how many minutes would it take from-
okay .
assuming that your hotel is located somewhere in % uh orchard road .
% uh it will take you approximately-
% uh it 's actually quite nearby but because there 's no direct line from orchard road
so you will have to % uh plan about % uh twenty minutes .
twenty minutes .
yes .
because you will have to change line .
okay .
okay .
so another % uh
so the dress code , do you need to tell-
to % uh-
do you need me to tell you about dress code ?
yes .
sure .
okay , it will be party wear .
i mean % uh night % uh clubs outfit .
i 'm sorry ?
% uh yes .
okay .
yah .
okay .
so you understand what i mean , right ?
yes .
okay , another-
yes ?
% uh so-
so the clubs in singapore also have dress codes .
% uh yes .
okay , another % uh club that i would like to introduce you
would be this one that i 'm going to show you now .
what is the name of this club ?
it 's s-
this is quite a few clubs in there .
it 's called saint james power station .
so in one building , there 's % hm a few clubs or several clubs in that building ?
yah .
yes .
there are few % uh different kind of clubs that you can see % uh in this power station .
it 's not used as a power station anymore .
there are clubs in there .
so you have different themes in this % uh park
so you can hop from one to the other .
so kind of bar hopping from one to another .
yah .
so-
% uh yah , what i mean is you can go-
if you do n't like this club , you can go till then move on to the next one and the next one .
alright .
so this is in saint james power station .
to the another .
yah .
and % um lynnette .
yes .
% hm i would also like to ask you about the gadgets in singapore .
because i-
gadget ?
yes .
% uh what sort of gadgets are you talking about ?
% hm like places where i can buy gadgets .
% uh computers , laptop , so on and so forth ?
yes , or like-
yes .
okay .
now this is one % uh % uh shopping complex % uh that you can % uh visit .
it 's called funan digilife or funan it mall .
okay , this is the funan it mall .
an it mall .
yes .
the location is just near the-
it 's about seven minutes ' walk from city hall mrt .
so from my hotel , from there , i 'm gon na have a little ride at mrt .
yes .
it 's quite convenient to ride the mrt % uh in singapore .
okay .
yes .
so % uh like i mentioned , this is near the city hall mrt train station .
yes .
oh and yes , we have n't % uh introduced you to any hotel yet .
% uh i 'm sorry .
okay .
so the it mall , there are a number about five levels of shopping .
and these % uh every other shop sells it related products .
for example from cameras right up to laptops to accessories % uh can be found in this mall .
yes .
yes .
that 's right .
it 's a five level building .
yes .
% uh yeah .
and it 's all % uh it related products in there .
so you can spend-
up to you , you know , the-
how many hours you take to find % uh the product that you wanted to buy .
oh % uh yes .
yes .
yup .
% hm so now lynnette % hm how about the accommodation or the hotel that i will-
okay .
for the hotels in singapore , they have various % uh ranges % uh in terms of price range .
yes .
so we have % uh let 's say the three to the four star hotels % uh ranges from about
hundred and fifty % uh onwards to about two hundred .
% uh and of course we have the three hundred to four hundred range and four hundred and above .
or even the % uh what you call the value hotels , the budget hotels .
% um budget hotels because i only have one thousand singapore dollars and there are three of us .
okay .
alright .
so-
okay , i can give you these budget hotels .
okay .
these are some of the budget hotels that we have in singapore .
okay % uh one of the companies that runs these ho-
budget hotels is called % uh hotel eighty one .
hotel eight .
okay .
yes .
and they are pretty small hotel .
i mean the rooms are pretty small .
% um okay .
so this is nearer for you dickson or chinatown .
yes .
okay .
there 's also this budget hotel in chinatown .
% hm is it a part of chinatown or i will ride again ?
% uh no .
it 's actually right in the heart of chinatown .
but just bear in mind , the rooms are not that big .
the mrt .
okay .
yah .
so these are-
well , that 's fine .
yah .
so price range would be in the region of about a hundred and fifty .
price range .
okay .
so these are just some pictures of the-
% uh okay .
hotels .
% uh budget hotels .
yah .
so there are few % uh budget hotels located in orchard road .
even this one at beach road .
so the hotels in singapore are located-
% uh most of the hotels in singapore are located in arch-
it's-
is it archer road , am i right ?
yes .
orchard , o r c h a-
orchard road , yah .
orchard -
i 'm sorry , orchard road .
okay , thank you .
so quite a lot of hotels are located along orchard road .
but of course if you choose to live further away , there are also hotels available .
but because you are going to spend just a few days here
so i would recommend that you stay closer % um around chinatown .
that 's one at beach road .
you can stay in this % uh beach road area as well .
yes .
okay .
and this one , it 's also okay .
hotel grand chancellor .
yes , hotel grand chancellor .
okay .
but if you want to stay in orchard road , there are also other hotels out there as well .
alright .
yup .
okay .
would you want to consider backpackers ?
% hm i heard backpackers a lot so it 's kind % uh % hm familiar hotel so i like that one .
you like % uh backpackers hotel ?
yes .
okay , we have backpackers hotel .
just now we mentioned about you like history , right ?
yes .
okay .
can i recommend you one hotel , budget hotel ?
% uh that is located just right in the heart of another cultural area .
oh that 's great .
and this one-
yah , this is called sleepy sam .
% hm so the budget hotel is near the cultural areas of singapore
or % uh another cultural area ?
% uh just now i mentioned about the budget hotel like hotel eighty one .
that 's one in chinatown .
yes .
yes .
okay .
okay .
so you also mentioned about you like history .
so we already talked about chinatown .
so that is the chinese area .
yup .
sleepy sam .
yah .
so now i can recommend you an-
% uh this is actually a backpackers ' hotel
and it 's located in another cultural place called kampong glam .
kampong glam .
what 's kampong glam ?
okay .
kampong is a malay word , it means village
and glam is actually named after glam trees .
so there used to be a lot of glam trees that 's found in this kampong but no longer now .
we only have a few of this glum tree that 's left .
% uh this is the location of the % uh sleepy sam .
yes .
alright .
and the-
it 's % uh also near the mrt called bugis .
okay .
so it will be a different kind of location from the chinatown budget hotel .
this one would be % uh in the so-called malay and the arab quarters .
yup .
and that 's great .
% hm so % um lynnette % hm i would like to ask if % um
is there % hm for the fee of a tour guide .
yes .
okay .
% uh it all depends .
you can go to the guides online and you can call up the guides if you want to do a half-day tour .
% uh the charges depends , alright , on the guide .
% uh normally % uh the guides will charge like let 's say % uh in the range of-
from-
for one person , two person , it does n't matter .
okay , from the range of let 's say-
because this would be like a private basis or small group of people .
% um and if you are just talking about % uh walking tours
% uh that-
they will charge probably in the range of twenty five dollars per hour .
yup .
okay .
yes .
twenty five dollars .
yes , approximately .
% hm so that 's % hm-
for example there are three of us .
yes .
so twenty five dollars per hour , am i right ?
yes .
so that would be about % uh-
no , i mean like i said , it does n't matter how many of you .
% uh okay .
% uh it's-
so yah , so approximately about twenty five dollars per hour .
yah .
okay , otherwise you can walk around on your own % uh if you choose to stay in sleepy sam .
% uh you are in the malay quarters so this is kampong glam and % uh
kampong glam , as you can see from the left-hand side of-
yes .
as-
yup .
the % uh picture .
there is a picture of a mosque and this is called the sultan mosque .
this picture will show you a street scene in % uh kampong glam .
% uh over here , of course , it 's used to be the malay quarters .
you will find malay cuisine out here .
yes .
yes .
yes .
malay cuisines % uh .
% uh yes .
so malay cuisines are a little bit more spicy food compared to the chinese food .
and do you want me to introduce you to some malay food ?
yes of course .
alright .
the malay food % uh compared to the chinese will be more spicy .
so we have like simple dishes called mee siam .
mee siam .
mee siam is actually the small thin white noodles .
yes .
% um and we put in a sour kind of a sauce % uh together with this-
with a hard-boiled egg .
% um so this is % uh % um mee siam .
alright .
% hm is it really hot ?
% uh a little bit spicy . it 's a little bit sour and spicy .
% uh a little bit spicy . it 's a little bit sour and spicy .
% uh this is % um mee siam .
alright .
otherwise we do have also % uh another malay food called % uh mee soto .
that 's fine .
yes .
okay , mee siam -
mee soto , it 's a noodles with-
cooked in % um chicken straps .
yes .
with a little bit of soup .
% um not that spicy , just a tinge of spice .
% uh okay , so this will be malay food .
alright .
yes .
because i like spicy foods and i believe i will like it .
okay , sure .
and there are also some % uh restaurants in % uh kampong glam .
alright .
% uh and they serve % uh rice with dishes .
we call it the nasi padang .
nasi padang .
yes .
nasi is % um a malay word , it means rice .
okay , and you get to choose your dishes in % uh to go with your rice .
yup , so that's-
there is a ri-
that 's a rice in a bowl or something like that .
yes , you get your rice and % uh
you have this % uh dishes like for example , fried chicken % uh vegetables but of course they are spicy .
usually they are spicy .
% um and % uh so that is % uh malay food , yah , in % uh in kampong glam , nasi padang .
yah .
yes .
okay .
and also you can have another malay food called % uh satay .
% uh satay , what 's that food ?
okay , this food is % um % uh marinated meat .
you can have % uh chicken % uh mutton % uh marinated and they pierce through a skewer
and it 's barbecued over charcoal and you dip them with a peanut sauce % uh spicy peanut sauce .
so that is another very typical % uh malay food in % uh where you can % uh find in % uh singapore .
alright , so this is malay food .
% uh the other-
and you can also even get indonesian cuisine % uh over in kampong glam .
yes .
yes .
yup .
yes .
okay .
so you have this like a smashed % uh chicken with rice .
we call it ayam penyet .
% uh that is-
ayam pen-
yes , that you can also find in kampong glam as well as in other parts of singapore .
% hm how about other cuisines that you have in singapore or in that place ?
% uh in kampong glam itself ?
yes , in glam-
yes .
okay .
there are % uh mid-eastern % uh cuisine that you can find in % uh kampong glam .
egyptian-
% hm egyptian .
turkish .
% uh even mediterranean and there 's even a swedish cafe % uh that 's found in kampong glam .
it's-
% hm so it 's a mix of different countries or restaurants from different countries .
% uh but in kampong glam , mainly it will be malay cuisine
and indonesian i would say .
yah .
% uh malay cuisine .
% uh okay .
but like i said , there are some arabic % uh egyptian and turkish % uh restaurants
that 's found in kampong glam itself .
in the-
yup .
would you want to pay a visit to the mosque ?
yes , of course .
okay .
so again-
yes , you ca-
you are permitted to enter the sultan mosque in kampong glam .
yes .
and lynnette , i have a question .
yes .
% um are there people still worship in that mosque ?
% uh yes .
it is a living mosque so yes , people do visit the mosque to pray .
% uh the mosque will be crowded in the afternoon
% uh on friday .
on friday .
yes .
% uh on other days % uh that would be fine .
but on friday % uh they would not want to admit any % uh visitors % uh
because they are going to have their prayers , the congregational prayers on friday .
alright .
so you are coming on the fourteenth , it 's fine .
fourteenth of may is actually monday .
okay .
% hm are they all % hm still-
i 'm sorry .
are there dress codes implemented in that mosque ?
% uh yes .
% uh all the places of worship % uh would have a dress code .
so again % um % uh pants must be below the knee .
yup .
% uh shorts or t-shirts % uh with the shoulders covered .
yes .
% uh otherwise if you are not so % uh properly dressed % uh the-
% uh sultan mosque will provide a cloth % uh for people to wear tourists to put over their clothes
% uh if they are not properly % uh covered up .
so we will pay for that-
% uh there is no admission to visit the % uh sultan mosque .
for that clothes ?
okay .
% uh but if you are non-muslim % uh then we would not encourage you
or we would % uh ask you to refrain from getting into the prayer hall .
okay .
got it .
okay .
so that is % uh the other-
second culture that we 're talking about % uh in singapore .
yah .
yes .
% hm what 's the third one ?
okay , we have another culture called the indians .
alright .
so traditionally % uh these ethnic areas are where people used to live in the past .
the various ethnic area .
% uh so okay .
so this little india again , it is accessible by the subway .
so it 's a place , little india , am i right ?
yes .
little india in singapore .
okay .
i 'm gon na show you some of the images here .
okay .
yes .
i think it 's not-
% hm is there-
% uh yah .
yah , okay .
this is % uh one of the street scene in % uh little india .
% hm so these houses % hm what year they were built ?
% uh which period of time they are built ?
in these houses .
like % um this one in the street .
% uh the year that they were built , is it ?
yes .
okay .
now little india % uh would be in the range of about a hundred years old
because they % uh came a bit later after the chinese quarters .
yes .
it 's member-
% uh when everybody came here , they live in chinatown area .
and it was very crowded so people started moving away .
so they would be in the range of about a hundred years % uh for little india .
and % um what do you call % hm this transportation that-
% uh these bikes ?
okay , these % uh vehicles , we call them the trishaws .
they are three-wheeled vehicles .
tricycle .
you do n't see % uh them plying % um the other parts of the street-
% uh other parts of singapore
because they have designated % uh trishaws stations that these trishaws can park .
so it 's not going to be very easy for you to flag a taxi % uh
for example on an % um on other roads in singapore .
s-
okay .
would you be interested to get on one ?
% uh yes .
i like to .
these are just used for sightseeing purposes .
% uh like i mentioned , the trishaw men can only ride on designated % uh roads in singapore .
so you can not tell him % uh i want to % uh go to changi airport , then that 's not possible .
so the-
alright .
yes .
yah .
so designated area around the chinatown or the % um % uh at
% uh little india .
yah , little in-
yah , i 'm sorry .
% uh little india area % um as well as around the padang area , that 's about it for the trishaw ride .
so these were now used for sightseeing % uh purposes .
% uh so-
and you have to get to the trishaw station % uh to get on to these trishaws .
okay .
% hm as-
and they also have a station .
that 's great .
yes .
% uh the station % uh is % um located near bugis
% uh and you can see the trishaw there .
okay , that 's great .
so-
and this house is-
they were around hundred years ago
so this house is some kind of history for this place .
this is-
it 's little india .
yes .
yes .
yes , so % uh i have introduced you-
to you three of our main cultures % uh that we have here .
alright .
% uh okay .
and thanks a lot and thank you for your help .
much appreciated .
we do have actually one more culture .
% uh i 'm sorry for that .
okay .
yah we do have one more culture .
% uh yes .
and that is located in the eastern part of singapore .
we call them the peranakans .
one last culture .
okay .
okay , let me see that one .
okay .
are these % um-
for example this little india , the chinatown % hm is it nearby to one another ?
or rather-
% uh yah .
nearby to one another ?
yes .
yes , they are quite near to one another .
% uh in the sense that % uh it 's just about less than half an hour from one another % uh taking the mrt .
mrt .
okay .
yah .
so you would be able to get from one place to another within half an hour
if you 're going to use the mrt .
alright .
that 's great .
yah .
so the next % uh culture i 'm going to introduce to you would be-
it 's easy for you to get to the museum called the peranakan museum .
again , this is just near city hall mrt .
peran-
and this group of people were originally chinese people .
but % uh what they have done is % uh we call them the straits borns
so when they came to singapore , the men first came and they inter-married with the local non-malay lady-
% uh the local % uh non-muslim ladies .
and with it , finally they evolved their own culture called the peranakans .
yes .
s-
so these people from china , they were married too ?
the men .
yes , the men came from china and they inter-married with the local-
local ladies ?
non-muslim ladies .
non-muslim ?
% uh so that 's the peranakans .
yah , so this is a traditional dress .
we call them-
just now those ladies , they are wearing their kebayas .
very beautiful clothes .
so this will be the peranakan museum .
so in this museum -
% hm just-
sorry ?
i 'm sorry .
in this museum % um are they still strict in dress codes ?
% uh no .
for the museum , it 's okay .
you can just go .
% uh no strict dress code .
% uh but of course , you know % uh no swimming attire .
yah .
so you can go like-
just like shirts and shorts .
yes , you can wear shorts % uh if you want to go to the museum .
that 's fine .
okay .
% hm are there shows or cultural shows in this museum ?
% uh most of the time there will be no cultural show .
% uh but at % uh let 's say certain events , yes , can-
% uh there may be a show or a tour % uh for the museum otherwise % uh no .
for the time of may % uh no , we do n't have like any special % uh events that 's going to come out .
let 's see any upcoming % um-
so-
so it 's from octob~oct-
i 'm sorry , it 's october till april , am i right ?
% uh october , what do you mean ?
sorry ?
% hm the events .
% uh no .
it all depends on % uh whether-
i 'm talking about % uh event-
% uh the museum would be on-going .
alright .
yes .
let 's see .
i do n't think there 's any special events coming out in % uh may .
let 's see may .
any special events .
% hm yes .
yes , so what month do you have for the events in that museum ?
okay .
we 'll have to see .
okay .
usually % uh during school holidays , the museum have some % uh special events that 's played .
yes .
yup .
okay .
okay for the may thirteen , i guess you have not arrived .
yah , this one is-
it 's for the children .
they have this make a bouquet of flower , paper flowers % uh with % uh peranakan motif .
alright oh that will be for mother 's day .
% uh for mother 's day .
yah , and otherwise the next event will be in june .
% uh yah .
because that would be the june school holidays in singapore .
so otherwise the museum , it 's very nice to visit .
% uh lots of things to see , very different % uh culture from the other two cultures that i 'm talking about .
okay .
yes .
okay .
so let 's see any-
there are-
i think there 's no special % uh events in the month of may except
% uh for may the thirteenth where they have this children 's workshop for mother 's day .
yes .
and then june .
am i right that 's june ?
yah .
then yes , otherwise the on-going % uh exhibition will always be on-going
so we always have the current % uh exhibition .
okay .
so you will always see the current exhibitions and that 's always on-going .
but in the peranakan museum collection .
yes .
% hm is it the clothes of the-
it 's woman ?
% uh yes , we have % uh the kebaya collection .
but this one will end in eight of april .
you will still see some % uh small collection of kebayas .
% uh that 's the traditional clothes of the peranakans .
you will see a lot of % uh cutlery % uh crockery that were used by the peranakan
which is very different from the other two culture .
% uh and of course , you see like wedding % uh rituals % uh what do the peranakans do ?
% uh even in % uh death as well , funeral % um % uh yah , rituals .
% uh what do the peranakans do ?
how do their house look like ?
so basically that 's what you 're going to see in the peranakan museum .
it 's a very beautiful % uh very colourful % uh museum .
yes .
yup .
yes .
yup .
okay .
and lynnette for the peranakans % um what are-
% hm what is the religion of this culture or this people ?
okay , because they were originally chinese men and they inter-married with local non-malay-
% uh non-muslim ladies .
so they are still very much % uh traditionally .
% uh they are still very much % uh buddhist .
but % uh along the way , quite a number of them had converted to christianity .
% um buddhist .
okay .
so they actually mix % uh in their house , the traditional one .
% uh you still see chinese altars % uh in the house .
% uh that 's beautiful .
and % hm lynnette-
yes .
% hm i think i 've seen enough .
and i 'd like to thank you for this call and hope you had a good time .

% uh yes .
if you take a dorm bed
per person only twenty dollars .
if you take a room ,
it 's two single beds at fifty nine dollars .
and that would be fifty nine for two beds .
wow , that 's good .
tak~
okay .
that sounds go~
yah , the prices are based on per person per bed or dorm .
but this one is room .
so it should be fifty nine for the two room .
so you 're actually paying about ten dollars more per person only .
oh okay .
that's-
the price is reasonable actually .
it 's good .
is it near at train station or something like a public transportation station ?
yes .
little india has got two tran stations -
two stops .
they are actually quite close to each other .
that 's little india stop and the farrer park stop .
and your hotel would be in that vicinity .
so you see you get here , you get breakfast , dinner .
that means you get your towel , you got a locker
and internet access .
okay .
okay , is it-
wow .
okay .
and that 's for a fifty nine singaporean dollar ?
yes .
if you take a bit more luxurious
a double room ,
a double bed and a single bed .
that means one of you sleeps in a bigger bed .
it 's that 's fifty nine dollars .
that would be for three people i think .
okay .
yah .
okay .
great .
that sounds great .
so % uh is it near the airport ?
% uh no .
but you can get there easily by taking the trains
% uh from the airport .
you just need to make a change in the train direction .
if you went for example all the way to chinatown
so you will have to cha~
take a change of trains .
% ah okay .
because i have no idea at all about singapore trains or transit .
% uh how can i go to the train or to the transit from the airport ?
is it just outside the airport ?
okay , i'm-
yes .
% uh it 's actually at the basement
the airport .
and that is the first thing you should do when you arrive .
% uh change some local money
and then % uh you take the train .
% uh you buy the card first .
you buy the card and % ah you pay a deposit .
you put money into the card then after that
you do n't have to worry about having enough change
to % uh pay the fare .
a card ?
yes , card , okay .
okay .
oh , % uh so it means that i can use that card any day ?
yes , you can use the card % uh-
as lo~
as lo~
yes , as long as it has a credit , right ?
that 's right .
as long as you got money in it
% uh you will get a card .
okay .
so it 's not a problem .
okay .
and % uh % um waiting for it to download
the map .
let me see .
okay , it 's coming on now .
good .
okay .
then i can show you % uh the location of your hotel
and in relation to where the airport is .
okay , if you look on the right-hand side of the sccren ,
can you see changi airport at the bottom right-hand where number three is ?
yes , please .
yes .
yes , i can see it .
changi airport .
so-
chang~
that is right .
okay .
so when you reach the airport
you go down to the basement .
% uh this would be the airport terminals conduc~
connecting terminals one , two , and three .
if you are at a budget hotel -
% uh budget airport ,
you have to take a shuttle to the main airport and then go to the bus stat~
to the % um train station
and-
okay .
% uh is it far from the airport
or i tak~
or i can just walk to the a~
no , it 's between the airport
but it 's easier to just take the shuttle .
it 's a free shuttle that runs bet~
oh .
yah .
so you get your ticket ,
you pay your deposit .
and i think at the airport they gave you a map .
and-
to give you an idea .
so all this is free .
and then you travel along the east line towards the west .
can you see tanah merah on the second stop ?
okay .
okay , a map .
% hm , tanah merah , yes .
okay .
so that is where you change to go down to town to the west
towards the west .
and you go down to-
just give me a minute .
to % uh , i think the easiest way is to go to outram park .
can you see where it goes all the way down and it curves up a little bit ?
outrum park .
yah .
quantrum park , is that-
yes .
o u r t -
o u t r -
% ah outra~
okay , outram park .
yes .
alright .
so when you get up there ,
you take the line towards little india .
so it 's one , two , three stops and you are at little india .
% hm , okay .
so this is the place that you can go out and try street food
you can soak in the atmosphere .
you would love taking your camera out
because you can photograph the indian garland makers , the fortune tellers .
% uh it 's full of life and culture .
it 's one of my favourite places .
oh-
oh , great .
oh
yah .
is little india is like a indian community town or indiantown ?
yes .
so there are hindu temples there .
you can photograph beautiful architecture and statues
of the different deities , the hindu deities .
okay .
great .
so other than indiantowns ,
are there other % uh nations town there or race town ?
other than chinatown and indiatown .
what else ?
okay .
yes .
okay , little india if you are visiting the temples ,
you avoid from about twelve noon to four o'clock ,
they have a break .
so you go early morning or you go in the evening .
and then chinatown you take the same line .
can you see chinatown ?
two , three stops down ?
so you 'll get off at chinatown , you are right in the heart of chinatown .
and in chinatown we have % uh also bhuddist temple and terrace temple also great for photography .
yes .
yes , okay .
okay , great .
so we have little india , then chinatown
other than that two ,
there are other kinds of town , right ?
like % uh-
is there a % um something like vietnamese town or just the two of these ?
not vietnamese but there is % uh kampong glam which you have to go by bus because-
well actually you could go by train
because you are young and healthy you can walk .
% uh go-
yah , i like walking .
you go to % um , city hall station .
so let 's say you are at little india ,
you got ta run to dhoby ghaut .
can you see dhoby ghaut ?
% uh dhoby ghaut , yes .
yah , just one stop % uh towards the south .
and then you take the red line which is called the circle line
and you get just one stop at city hall station .
and when you get off ,
ask the direction to beach road .
so not only do you walk towards the malay quarter or rather the historic % uh , quarter for the malays
the malays have mainly moved out from there .
but there 's a beautiful mosque there and on the way you will pass raffles hotel
which is a historic hotel and also a consolation buidling .
% hm , okay .
% ah okay .
okay , great .
what about at night ?
% uh what other activities can we do with my friend during the night ?
% uh do you like barhopping % uh or just-
you still want to walk around , stroll around and take in the sights .
% uh maybe after barhopping may be we can just stroll around .
oh wait , i have a question .
is it safe there to walk -
just walk around at night ?
% uh , you can-
yes , very safe .
% um , you do n't just flash go chains around your neck ,
you 'll be okay .
it 's quite safe .
i understand .
yah .
is there a like curfew in singapore ?
no curfew .
we have n't heard of one for a long time .
% um most singaporean 's will not know what you mean when you say curfew .
% ah , okay .
so it would n't matter if we just stroll around at three o'clock in the morning , something like that ?
yah , no problem .
% uh no problem at all .
so if you take your train like little india you would take the train to dhoby ghaut ,
you take the circle line down ,
and you go down to marina bay .
that 's a very scenic area by the river
and you could walk around there and you-
if you want the bus ,
you go down to clarke quay .
just clarke quay there ?
and we-
it 's not shown on the map but we have a river there
and you could go barhopping , you could eat ,
you could pick-up some girls .
oh , great .
oh , yes , i see that .
okay .
yah .
no , i 'm not intested .
okay .
% ah okay .
but you meet a lot of people there that
you know , they will might just talk to you if they are tourists .
yah , i-
yah , i like making friends specially with other-
yah other people or in strange place % uh like singapore .
okay , because % um i have a friend who just go to other countries % uh just having his backpack and then just leave his things in a room or in a hotel
and roam around take pictures .
i 'm gon na thinking to do the same thing .
yes .
yah , that is really good .
% uh another place say , okay , the next day i~
or if you want to go to attractions to take photos % ah of animals , you-
i suggest you go through the % uh wildlife safari 's park
% uh which you can also reach by train and by bus .
yes .
% uh wait , i have a question .
on that weekend ,
will there be an occasion , special occasion that 's going to happen in singapore where i can go and take some pictures ?
yah .
% uh it 's more-
it 's also easter for the catholics and the christians in singapore .
so you might want to go to midnight mass .
% uh , i do n't know whether the priest will be happy if you are using your flash taking photos .
but % uh in the day the churches are very beautiful to photograph .
they are not decorated but % uh , you will be able to photograph them .
yah .
okay .
yah , actually it 's quite nice .
what about in % uh outside the city ?
there is some place to go out from the city
where i can take pictures ?
yes , so % uh there are two places i want to suggest to you
one is the natural wildlife area .
it 's called sungei buloh wetland reserve
and there you can capture birds and crabs
% uh , monitor lizards , crabs climbing trees
and got-
% uh yes .
it 's all natural .
so once i bought a friend and he caughts a-
got a photograph of a monitor lizard eating a fish .
so it 's trail fo~
okay .
i 'll take note of that .
% um , crabs ?
% ah really ?
oh so they are all wild animals ?
yes , they are all wild and they are protected there .
so for bird photography is very good .
% uh and if you are really into bird photography
it 's from about september to april .
actually if you come now
right away
you can still catch some brids , % uh that are coming from mongolia .
so , you know , they are migratory birds .
.
is it far from my hotel ?
how long would it take to go there from my hotel ?
okay , from your hotel -
i do n't have the map now
but you connect with the % uh northbound line .
sorry , the westbound line
and you go all the way to kranji and then you take a bus .
% uh you see the kranji express here ?
you pay three dollars as an adult
and you get a ticket which you can use for your return journey .
oh !
so-
.
so approximately how long would it take to travel ?
because i do n't want to spend day on travelling or % uh riding bus or riding trains .
how long would it take ?
from you hotel to here
may be about 50 minutes or so
f you plan it correctly .
so you look at the train timing .
% uh you see the first line , kranji ?
that 's when the bus arrives to pick-up people .
so if you miss the nine o'clock ,
the next one is ten-fifteen .
but the alternative is if you miss this
you take the public bus and then you have to walk about half a kilometre from where the bus stops to the reserve .
if you take this bus ,
it drops you right outside .
yes .
% ah , oka~
oh , okay .
oh okay .
does it have an entrance fee ?
% uh , entrance free at the moment is free .
oh , so it 's free .
some day as they charge one dollar .
i might be wrong on that
it 's no more than one dollar anyway
which is nothing , you know ?
it 's % uh not even one u.s .
it 's one singapore .
and you see the rest of stops on the kranji express .
% uh they 've got a dairy farm where they have goats
producing goats milk .
% uh and % uh , yes .
so if you catch the bus on it 's whole journey ,
you get to visit the other farms .
but i think sungei buloh itself is enough to interest you .
% uh % huh , okay .
% ah yes .
% uh wo~
so if i go there and arrive % uh let say % uh in the evening
and then maybe take some rest
and then in the morning
what do you suggest to go first ?
where do you-
you need to come here in the morning
because they close about six o'clock , seven o'clock .
it will be too late to see anything .
% uh okay .
so that 's the first place that i should go to-
first thing in the morning ?
okay .
yes .
that is right .
so % um you could time yourself
so that when you come out of here ,
you could go to the bird park
so that if no birds waive at you at this park ,
you go to the bird park and they all be smiling at you .
okay .
great .
so bird park ,
i like bird park .
okay .
let me try and get it for you here .
jurong is the place it is at
and it 's also well not too far from here ,
so it 's convenient to go .
b i r d p a r k ,
okay .
i 'm getting some noise at your sector .
% ah , okay .
oh !
oh yah .
i do n't know what 's that .
but it 's outside the room .
you can hear it ?
can you hear it ?
oh it 's ou~
yes , i can hear it .
it sounds like an airplan flying by..
it sounds like an airplan flying by..
okay , so here we have got bird shows ,
you 'll be very good at taking photographs here .
birds are there .
% uh this aviary ,
can you see it on your screen ?
yes , african waterfall aviary .
yes , the birds are flying free ,
african -
really ?
yes , so-
nice .
okay , well test your skill as a photographer .
yah i would .
% uh actually it 's interesting .
and we also have a show ,
% uh two shows in fact .
% uh during showtime
they offer you to hold a falcon ,
and you can photograph your friend and he can photograph you .
yah , alright .
and at the sho~
other than birds , what other animals can we take a picture ?
so this is the bird park
but , okay , i 'm going to see % uh ticketing , alright ?
because i 'm suggesting that you buy a package ticket
so that you can get , okay-
so you see it 's open from eighty-thirty 'till six .
and can you see this ?
the one that 's % uh a bit darker in colour .
that is a package .
it 's called a park hopper special .
oh !
% ah okay park hopper special , okay .
for adults it 's fifty eight singaporean dollar .
yah , you see three parks ?
you see the zoo ?
the night safari .
which i suggest on the same day so that you can just walk from the zoo ,
and the night safari is next door .
and then the bird park you go % uh on the day you go sungei buloh
because you can take the train connection
from kranji , you would just go southwards and you are at jurong ,
and you just take a bus and you are there .
dol~
yah .
oh !
oh okay , great .
great .
i 'm planning to go there .
% ah nice
% uh okay .
so what about other than street food ,
of course i have to eat my dinner .
wha~
where do you suggest me to eat my dinner ?
the day that you are going to the night safari and zoo ,
i suggest you eat at the night safari or zoo .
we have some restaurants there .
% uh they have something cute called the bongo burger .
% hm , the-
bongo burger .
is that a singaporean burger ?
no .
the bongo is one of the names of the animals there .
but it 's not
.
i heard it 's a special singaporean food .
no , it 's not .
they just used the name of the animal .
% um , at the bird park too ,
they have a restaurant .
so that would make it much easier .
you would save time .
okay .
yah , because i also want to experience singaporean delicacies or singaporean dishes .
% uh sing~
do you like hot food ?
do you like curries ?
curries ?
yah .
indian curries ?
yah i like indian curries .
what about singaporean ?
do they taste the same ?
% uh the curries that you get in the place where ,
you know , in little india
they are authentic indian taste .
but if you tell them that you do n't want so much chili
or , you know , to tell you which one is very hot ,
then they can tell you and you can avoid ordering those % uh dishes .
% uh but west coast road we have restaurants that serve
north and south indian restaurants .
% uh south indian food .
both north and south .
% ah okay .
what about singaporean restaurants ?
like they ,
you know , they offer singaporean delicacies or singaporean dishes ?
do you have a singaporean dishes in singapore ?
% uh , singaporean food is mostly try at the % uh food courts .
% uh so it is not % uh ,
what do you call it ?
fine dining .
but it 's where you can actually see everybody cooking
and % uh in fact ask the person what is he doing whether they were be very nice to-
happy to accomodate you .
and then you can-
at the one place you can try chinese , malay and in~
% uh mostly chinese food .
these 's one i am recommending to you .
it 's at old market .
let me get it on the website .
it 's maxwell road food centre .
road food centre .
so it is at place called maxwell road
which is in chinatown .
so if you take the train to chinatown from where you are
and you'd-
it 's near .
you just walk there .
so here you have a picture of the food centre .
can you see the stalls on both sides ?
yah , it 's just near , right ?
yes .
so all this different coloured signs are different stalls .
and if you like , you-
if you go at different times ,
you get different kinds of food
or rather somes stalls if they are shut ,
they are operating later or earlier .
% hm % hm , nice .
okay , nice .
is it okay to take pictures on public-
in public places ?
yes , it 's okay .
here it 's okay .
it 's only at the places of % uh worship that you have to be a bit more careful .
and maybe ask for permission .
but the-
in what kind of places ?
like in a hindu temple or at a bhuddist temple .
% uh you know the people who are praying would not like to photographed .
yah , i understand .
but what about in government offices like-
or government buildings
% uh i do n't know , may be some policemen might-
% uh at the airport % uh discourages % uh photographs .
so you do n't take photographs inside the airport .
% hm , so ou~
but outside the airport , it 's okay ?
outsie the airport if you are taking yourselves standing at the gate ,
i do n't think anybody will make any noise .
it 's just when you are inside there .
i think all airports are about the same now .
okay .
okay , good .
% uh , thank you for touring me ,
what to do in singapore .

are you thinking of staying on the island or % uh-
% um , is there a hotel you can recommend which is in-
within the city wherein it 's very near all the places that ,
you know we can also visit ?
well , there are many hotels % uh that are very % uh moderately priced .
% uh in the chinatown area .
and near to the island there are other business class hotels like a hundred over dollars .
but if you want to save the money on-
to spend time on sho~
% uh spend the money on shopping and other things
then we have the three-star hotels .
but-
oh is it okay ?
oh is it nice too even if it 's only three storey ?
even only it 's a three-star hotel ?
% uh the space is small within the rooms
because most of the them are in conservation shophouses .
% ah okay .
so anyway , is it near right , transportation and also is it near like convenience store
wherein we can go to ?
ye~
yes . very near .
yes . very near .
okay .
% uh convenience stores and shops and food and you can walk around and soak in the atmosphere .
so the location is very good , right ?
yes .
okay , how about-
and they 're also clean and they are , you know ?
it 's just that you do n't have a lot of space in there .
you do n't have the luxury of the five-star .
yes , just your % uh bed maybe or a dresser and a restroom , that 's it , right ?
yes , that 's right .
% uh usually they wi-fi , air-conditioning .

so that 's why i-
in april , right ?
in april , yes , it may rain .
% uh now if you want to bring a cardigan just for the air-conditioned areas .

% uh the-
it 's more the air-conditioning chilling up the place than the real cold .
okay .

% um- so if you want-
yah .
if you want to look at the hotels
let me do hotels first then i will come to the other attractions .
okay , please do .
and shopping .
thanks for your help .
thank you .
i really appreciate you helping me right go through like places we can go
to your beautiful country , singapore .
okay .
why is your country called the lion city ?
why lion city ?
when the-
a prince came to singapore long ago , he saw an animal .
and he was told that far away
there is an animal called a singa which is lion .
oh , singa .
do you call a lion in singapore singa ?
is it called singa ?
actually-
singa .
that 's how-
that 's why it 's singapore , you see ?
but actually we do n't have lions naturally found here .
oh , okay .
% uh we have tigers or we once had tigers here in the jungle but not lions .
so he could have seen a tiger .
okay .
he could have seen a wild boar and he was given the wrong information .
so singapore was called the lion city , right ?
yah , that 's right .
okay , that 's wonderful .
oh , we 've stuck with that name .
okay , now i know .
% uh maybe it 's confusing for people
who know their natural history , right ?
i know .
how about your culture ?
can you tell me something about your culture ?
i mean people in singapore
how are they ?
% uh we 're multi-cultural .
okay .
% uh different % uh races here .
chinese , being the majority .
and then we have malays and indians .
and we also have % uh eurasians , europeans , % uh large expatriate of communities .
so it 's very easy to visit singapore .
you can get all kinds of food .
% um and we are also very easy to move around i mean accessibility by train , by % uh-
oh , i see .
oh okay , train .
okay .
how about if i take a cab ?
would it cost me a lot of money if i do that ?
if you compare with europe , it 's much cheaper .
but it 's so much easier and % uh convenient to go by train and by bus .
oh so you have-
a train , okay .
so that will be easier , right ?
it 's a-
and cheaper too .
so % um-
yes , that 's right .
% uh okay , wait .
i got the wrong hotels here .
i put chinatown hotels and i got an american chinatown hotel .
okay .
let me do it again .
so which do you recommended-
recommend ?
just a minute .
okay .
can you tell me something about your history maybe ?
we were % uh-
but archaeological diggings have found that chinese have been coming here .
the arabs as well to trade .
so-
and that dates back long ago .
but % uh in 1819 , that 's the most recent history
a british official in the far east came here
and he brought along free trade .
okay .
he allowed people of different races to settle here , to trade here .
and he did n't charge taxes
and that 's why we became very popular with the people settling here and still today .
okay .
okay % um-
okay .
ha-
i heard singapore is a very safe city .
so there is no-
yes , it is .
the crime rate is i think zero to one percent .
am i correct ?
i do n't know the official crime rate
but what i know is that you just need to be careful with your belongings and not be a bit careless
so that , you know , people do n't just help themselves-
your things .
okay . so-
okay . so-
okay .
that 's wonderful .
how about your language ? what
how about your language ? what
what languages do you write , speak-
in singapore ?
is it % uh predominantly mandarin , hokkien or cantonese ?
english , it 's more english .
oh english , alright .
so-
or something that we call singlish which is-
a mixture of english with the-
chinese grammar .
oh-
and-
oh really ? can you tell me how it works ?
oh really ? can you tell me how it works ?
% uh why you so like that ?
that is-
oh , that 's singlish .
oh okay .
it 's singlish .
% uh that 's similar why are you behaving this way ?
in a friendly manner , you know ?
okay .
so it 's a-
you can probably make it out .
% uh it 's fun too .

% uh if you want to go and stay in chinatown
we have % uh little boutique hotels in chinatown .
okay .
and they 're also the cheaper hotels which are-
all the hotels there are usually not so spacious
because most of them occupy % uh conservation buildings .
oh yes .
that 's much shophouses .
they join them up like 6 or 8 and they make a hotel .
okay .
but they 're very decent inside . they 're
but they 're very decent inside . they 're
clean .
okay .
i mean i have friends in singapore
and they were telling me there were like-
there are hotels that are cheaply priced-
in about twenty dollars or i think one hundred dollars a day .
yes .
do you know where-
twenty dollars % uh budget-
yah .
twenty dollars , probably you 'll get a bed .
okay , just a bed .
okay .
i think you 'll get a bed .
% uh % hm % uh you-
if you 're interested we get the hostels for you .
let 's see from the website
how they are like .
so hostel , right ?
okay , let 's go for check it out .
i mean all you do is just sleep , right ?
you might as well so-
you know get something cheap
and just spend your money going out or maybe eating out or maybe shopping , right ?
yes , that 's right .
that 's right .
so % uh well this one is good , hangout hotels .
% uh can you see it ?
yes .
it 's not really bad .
it 's a-
shall i say it 's a good one i think .
is that a backpacker hotel , right ?
is it a backpacker hostel , right ?
it 's a hostel but it 's a good class hostel .
okay .
i also like the name , hangout .
hangout , yes .
just a minute .
we 're trying to get it to come on .
% uh so it 's % uh up-market backpacker .
okay .
let 's go check it out .
maybe you know i will-
you know rather stay in hangout hostel .
% uh the location is not bad .
the location is at upper wilkie road
which is within walking distance to an mrt station called dhoby ghaut -
no-
% um hm .
where we also have % uh very good % um % uh train connections if you want to go elsewhere .
okay .
so if i stay in hangout hostel
where , what-
places can i go to ?
you can shop at dhoby ghaut which is within walking distance .
oh so i can go there by foot , right ?
by foot , yes . it 's within walking distance and-
by foot , yes . it 's within walking distance and-
if you head at that-the other direction
you will be in little india
which is very full of heritage and culture and history
which i believe you mentioned earlier .
okay .
oh .
and a lot of food maybe .
yes , food .
food are all over the place .
in singapore , you can get food anywhere anytime .
% uh let me get the room rates for you .
okay .
so you have a picture of the room ?
the bed ?
yes , it looks nice .
oh dear .
they listed the budget
but the room rate is two hundred and eighty five .
and-
eighty five net .
yes , net .
sounds good .
% uh but that 's really not a backpacker rate .
i know .
that 's even more expensive than the other hotel with in cost
one hundred sixty eight dollars .
so this one is-
yes , that 's right .
right , more expensive .
% uh let me-
okay .
alright , here we go .
oh cheap .
okay .
this is another website .
okay .
so you can have a private room .
okay .
twenty dollars and % hm
maybe this is the place where , you know , my friends were telling me about
because it-
is surprisingly-
alright , it 's very cheap .
a hundred and twenty
% hm yes .
so i 'm assuming you want a room
because if you go dormitory
you see what i mean ?
twenty -
dollars is at dormitory .
yes , % uh % hm .
a twin room will be okay i guess .
yah .
just now i found for other people
even cheaper rooms in chinatown
but i think this is also fine .
looks good to me .
i mean but if , you know , if you are travelling
more than six people
then this will be good .
but for
i guess i would settle for
m hotel because it is like twin room , right ?
% uh % hm that 's right .
% uh i 'm guessing but i think the room may be a little bit bigger .
well , okay .
this is advisable for a group , right ?
package or a group tour .
okay .
% uh % hm yes .
% uh this hotel the one footprints that we are looking at now
it 's in the little india area .
perak road -
is it-
perak road .
so-
yes .
perak road -
perak is actually a place in malaysia .
% uh and this area here is right in the heart of little india .
so if you like indian culture
% uh this is the place to stay .
but if your preference is for more business class hotel and hotel with
little in~
okay .
what can i see if i go to little india ?
what can i see if i go there and try to check it out ?
what can i see ?
you-
if you go there early in the morning , let 's say about nine o'clock or eight thirty . ,
you can see people marketing .
% uh , shops .
you can see flower garland weavers
making fresh flower garlands .
and you can try the indian food .
% uh lots of vegetarian shops there .
oh like a flea market , right ?
% uh well we do n't call it a flea market
just individual shops and the prices are very low .
and very low .
okay .
so-
% uh , they are reasonable should i say .
and then you can go into the hindu temples .
they are very colourful .
okay .
and where is it located at ?
the hindu temple .
where is it at ?
can i see it ?
and-
okay .
are you still on the same map ?
can you see the map of footprints ?
can you see serangoon road -
yes .
to the left , perak road ?
so these little lanes are very short .
and if you turn to the left there , walk along serangoon road
there are about three , four hindu temples .
okay .
oh okay .
and if you walk to the back of it , there is a buddhist temple .
% uh two temples , there 's also a church there .
so % uh if you 're into heritage , this is really the place to be in .
it 's full of life , morning , noon and night .
okay .
so what other places should we visit while we 're in singapore ?
what other places should we go to ?
the other place for culture would be chinatown .
how about for adventure ?
because i 'm bringing along my nephew
maybe he would like to try i mean little like % um
what do you call extreme sport maybe ?
maybe % uh bungee jumping .
what else , huh ?
% uh bungee jumping i do n't think we have unless it 's purposely organised .
% uh we have-
do you know flying fox ?
% hm yes , i 've heard of it .
yes .
we have activities like that .
you know singapore , we want to be a little bit safe .
okay .
and bungee jumping , you also need some high cliffs or something , right ?
to-
okay .
% uh jump off .
how about a zip-line ride ?
do you have zip-line rides in singapore wherein , you know , we can , you know , visit it ?
so-
yes .
% uh let me try the bungee jump first .
oh we have this % uh reverse bungee jump .
oh , reversed .
yes .
have you heard of it ?
and this is very accessible .
it is % uh right along the singapore river .
so if you open your eye to get a lot to see while you are upside down .
% uh it is % uh set up right next to our singapore river
and % uh-
i 'm trying to get it .
can you see the little picture on the right ?
that same space .
oh .
yes .
% uh % hm one hundred percent pure nv adrenaline .
okay , i 'll be honest with you , i 'm a coward , i have n't been up on this .
oh , you haven't-
tried it ?
well it 's good .
yes .
i-
yes .
and it 's very accessible .
my nephew would like to ride .
yes % uh and you can-
you can also ride with him .
no , not me .
no .
not me , i 'm just like you .
i 'm too scared .
yah .
% uh a lot of tourists come here .
reverse bungee and gla~ giant swing .
okay .
over seven countries .
% uh the zip-line , i think you have to-
what is it you call it ?
can you give it to me again ?
zip-line .
% uh usually it's-
yah , usually it 's organised for groups like , you know , college students .
zip-line .
zip-line .
yah .
we used to have it on sentosa and % uh i do n't know if they still have it now .
where you zip from one end to the other end , right ?
yup .
% uh % huh it looks exciting .
well we have it a little bit out of town .
% uh okay , zip-line adventure park .
yes , you have it .
oh we have on sentosa , right at the bottom , but let me get to this one first .
this is a megazip adventure park .
yes , it 's on sentosa .
okay , let 's go check out the website .
you are brave if you dare to try zip-line .
i did paragliding in
% uh thailand and % uh
my nieces thought i-
i-
oh .
did you enjoy it ?
did you enjoy it ?
oh i enjoyed it , yes .
i enjoyed it very much
% uh except that , you know , the insurance does n't cover that .
oh there you go .
yah , so you really have to be an adventurist to do it .
zip-line is better , i think .
it 's safer .
yes .
than bungee jumping , right ?
it 's awesome , you feel like having one ride after .
so it go-
it goes through from what point till what point ?
% uh bungee jump -
% uh it 's the top of the hill , i think .
let me see , huh .
to the beach if i 'm not mistaken .
it looks good though .
yes , let me see it .
all these especially at % uh
the big organisers like this , they are very safe .
do n't have to worry .
but what is the most-
but what is the most popular spot in hong~
% uh rather in singapore that people go to ?
even the-
% uh the youngsters , they do this zip-line .
and they also go on their-
what do you call it ?
roller blades and skateboards .
% uh it 's a bit scary for people like me .
% uh oh there 's another one , that 's a new one on sentosa .
% uh i forget the name .
you 'll get into a % um
oh dear what is it called ?
let me try .
you get into % uh a small building and you have these people help you float in the air .
because the wind is blowing at you at high speed .
% uh you-
oh that's-
that can be-
so scary .
you put on a-
% uh no , you put on a suit .
you put on a protective suit and you wear tennis shoes .
i 've done it so it ca n't be that scary .
okay .
you were able to survive it , right ?
yes .
we all survived it so do n't worry .
so even here , can you see the harness is-
fully fitted .
yes , % uh % huh % uh % hm .
% uh that 's what-
so how much is it ?
how much will it cost me if i go to the zip-line ?
let me see if they have price .
have you ever tried this ?
no ?
no .
% um i was at the place where i could have tried it
but % uh i chickened out in the end .
because it 's too high speed for me .
okay .
i think you 're still very young , right ?
you sound very young .
yes , i sound young .
it 's a ploy .
i-
the zip-line prices are not on .
i think % uh it could be-
let me see .
zip-line sentosa should have it .
no , they are showing-
% hm maybe sixty dollars .
yah , something like that .
% um sometimes they organise it for a group
and then they have special prices .
it 's built-in with other adventures .
how about for me , right ?
i wan na go check out your % um casinos .
well , i like playing the slots .
where do i go ?
oh you can go into the casinos free of charge
because you 're a tourist .
no , where do i go to ?
um , resorts world ?
sentosa .
sentosa , okay .
yes , sentosa has one .
there 's another one at marina bay sands .
oh yah .
i 've heard about marina .
both of them are casinos .
yes .
oh you 're gon na show me a video .
wow .
wow .
that-
oh that 's long .
oh .
it 's okay .
no , i can not .
i think-
i do n't have the stomach for it .
i do n't think i will be able to-
cross it .
no .
so i think it 's from the top of the hill to one of the little islands there which is built off-just off the beach .
so you 're getting a view of the beach at sentosa .
oh .
yeah , but
the site is beautiful .
wow .
yes .
amazing .
% uh what you are hearing is the sound of the wind .
if you look at the video , i think that 's the sound of the wind .
right now ?
% uh just now when you saw the video with all the noise .
that was the sound of the wind-
because they are travelling at high speed .
% uh now we are putting up for you .
okay .
we have another zip-line at bedok reservoir road .
okay .
are you getting it on your screen here ?
yes , forest adventure or is it megazip adventure park ?
no , me~ megazip is what you just saw .
so we 're gon na -
go to forest adventure .
oh see , it 's like-
forest zip-
yes , forest adventure .
oh , it can also-
oh okay .
got it .
okay .
so-
and-
okay .
so do you know how much is it ?
do you know ?
do you have any idea how much it 's gon na cost me
if i go to forest adventure ?
okay , i 'm getting them on the line % uh to see if i can get any prices here .
okay , booking .
so there should be advance booking , right ?
yes .
because i think they need a minimum % uh
okay .
so we have their numbers there .
oh .
yes , and it's-
yes , eight hundred number .
so that will be fine so i can call them .
alright .
yes .
oh so we-
i have to choose a date
if i 'm gon na go to forest adventure , right ?
so i have to book-
ahead of time .
that 's right .
% hm yes .
because they do n't do it for you just for one person .
they need to have a number of people .
so you see here-
do you see here now ?
grand course time .
okay , oh so it 's also by age , right ?
places available .
and your weight , you can not be-
too heavy .
the line will not hold .
oh no .
i guess i 'm not gon na go to-
alright .
alright .
yah , that is % uh-
because i think i will-
no , i think-
i can .
i 'm not that heavy .
so you have to book in it .
i do n't know .
what-
so you like % um % uh you know like universal studio , right ?
% uh % hm maybe yes .
that and then % um zip-line , some shopping and-
maybe what else ?
and maybe at least like little india , right ?
some cultural sites .
let me get your-
first-
yah .
it would be
okay , but we only-
remember we only have two days so it 's gon na be a really hectic schedule .
that 's right .
% um , if you are very keen on culture
then little india stay would be good , otherwise-
% uh your % uh m hotel would be good .
oh , i have-
i have a very good question , ms. jeanne . i-
i have a very good question , ms. jeanne . i-
have a very good question .
and then-
you see it took-
so-
if i am a tourist visiting singapore for the first time-
okay , how many days would you advise me to stay in your country , so
i will be able to at least go through a lot of places ?
is it-
i would-
say five days .
five days is the ideal , right ?
number .
have five or six days .
okay .
i 'm a relaxed traveller . i
i 'm a relaxed traveller . i
like to do things slowly .
yes , it 's very hard
if you 're pressed for time .
so-
yah .
yah .
right ?
if you 're pressed for time and
you only have two days to fit in all the places you would like to visit .
i think that will be too stressful .
so five days , right ?
so five day-
will do ?
yes , too stressful .
yes .
% uh then you can go to other attractions , you see ?
but if i only have like a budget of maybe right , a thousand dollars , would it get me to a lot of places though ?
% uh you may have to downgrade your hotel .
% uh since you are able to travel by the mass rapid transit , the train system
let me get you on the mrt map .
you can find that you can get anywhere on it .
so maybe not too oh
i mean not do a lot of shopping maybe .
maybe i can just buy some souvenir , right , stuff-
but not really shop
because i mean i do n't have a lot of like extra money to bring with me , so
i think i can only bring a piece of thousand dollars and that 's it .
yes .
yes , then-
if
you spend your time-because when you shop you spend a lot of time .
instead of that , you can move to places .
so i really-
yes , on foot , right ?
because i was thinking like maybe that 's a good advice for me for us to downgrade our hotel and then try to like % uh , you know , take mrt .
% uh yes .
yes .
that 's right .
then you can travel .
do you see the map on your screen ?
and-
yes , and do n't shop a lot .
just , you know , just enjoy the place .
because there 's a lot of places that we can-
go to in singapore , right ?
and what about-
the food ?
what should i taste or try in singapore ?
what food ?
yes .
% uh try all the different kinds of food
and % uh if you are used to eating % um you know , adventurous in food , you do n't need to sit down at the restaurant .
then again not only do you save money .
but % uh you get % uh authentic local food and you can intermingle with the locals
at the food centres .
but what-
which one is your favorite ?
which one do you like eating the best ?
which one do you really like ?
i like a very old one .
but first let me finish the map here , okay ?
okay .
% uh can you see changi airport ?
yes % uh % huh .
so if you take down the train down the green line .
you just take it to tanah merah , can you see it ?
just two stops away .
look at number three on your right .
can you see number three on your right ?
that 's where changi .
airport is .
you would land at changi airport .
% uh yah .
changi airport .
so you just take a short shuttle to tanah merah and you take the westbound .
and you would be in town .
so depending on where you stay .
okay .
% uh if you choose to stay in little india , you will switch at city hall to dhoby ghaut .
can you see the red line ?
at % uh number eight .
number eight is a major interchange station .
okay .
and if you move up to the little india stop , there you are .
okay .
okay .
in little india-in between little india and farrer park , there are small % uh hotels there .
and i think we saw one of them just now , right ?
okay .
if you move the other way down to chinatown , there are also many little hotels .
okay .
and these hotels are converted shophouses .
okay .
so it 's % uh bit of heritage that you 're living in .
okay , so that 's a-
so-
good location to-
i mean visit , right ?
visit , yes , then you walk around .
so if you 're in little india , you visit the little india area on foot .
say in the morning .
and then you can move by train to chinatown and visit chinatown on foot .
little-
and then-
yes .
and also i can go to orchard maybe , right ?
it 's just not really that far .
yes .
orchard then you go connect the-
on the-
you go back to dhoby ghaut , which is the major interchange and full of shops there .
you at-
and eating places .
you move north to orchard .
in-
okay , that sounds wonderful .
you know what ?
so in little india , you try the indian food .
yah .
okay .
you 're going to say-
oh i like curry .
i like to eat curry .
yes , curry , you can get-
you take note of the name , race course road .
let me see if i can get it for you .
there are lot of restaurants there .
and along serangoon road which is the main road % uh in little india
you have many vegetarian restaurants also .
in fact it 's a great place % uh for vegetarians in little india
because many of the hindus here are vegetarian .
okay .
i read some-
i read it , right .
that you guys , singaporean guys , really like going to delis and you also are coffee drinkers , right ?
oh yes .
% uh once you pay for a cup of coffee you can get a whole % uh vegetarian meal -
in little india .
or chinese noodles in chinatown , you know like-
three , four dollars .
oh .
oh .
and-
you 're okay to go , right ?
for three to four dollars and
you know ?
yes .
you might need another
% uh a second portion if you have a healthy appetite .
% uh but otherwise , you know % uh it 's % uh more than enough .
for me it 's more than enough .
okay .
and we have this website called hungrygowhere .
okay .
and muthu curries is one of % uh my favourite places .
it 's on race course .
race course road .
okay .
the area used to be a race course in the days of the british .
when-
% hm well let-
fish head curry .
i 'm gon na try that
because it says here top must try dishes .
fish head curry , six votes .
oh i 'm gon na try that when i get there .
it looks-
yes .
that's-
you can take chili , right ?
you can take chilli ?
but not too hot .
% uh , okay .
you can tell them and maybe they can % uh modify you-
modify a bit for you
because we have many expatriates here
but some of them like it really hot .
the british expatriates % uh love it hot .
and also i-
ms. % uh jeanne , i also have one question .
% uh mirelle .
are singa~
yah , are singaporeans % uh friendly people ?
i mean are they friendly ?
are you guys friendly or-
i mean can we ask question maybe if we 're lost ?
or can you give us directions ?
are you guys approachable and friendly too ?
yes .
but you have to do the approaching .
normally we mind our own business .
so if you 're lost , we expect you to ask us and then we will be very helpful .
but they will maybe not come out and approach you .
although we 're trying to change that mindset right now .
okay .
okay .
so maybe i can say pardon or excuse me , i 'm kind of lost , can you give us direction
going to like-
orchard place or-
okay .
i 'll put that
yes .
yes .
they would be very helpful and if you get in to any train station % uh the officers there would be very happy to direct you .
okay .
okay .
i was supposed to show you the-
i want to just show you this about the % uh
okay .
train , you see the train map here ?
okay .
are you getting the maps or-
ez-link card .
this is a card we carry and i suggest you get it when you come .
okay .
oh so i do n't have to like , you know , shell out , change everytime i take the mrt , right ?
that 's right , you
do n't have to worry about it .
and the best place to get it is at the airport .
okay , so how-
how much is it ?
because % uh what-
you-
okay .
what is this ?
why am i getting this-
pictures ?
you see .
okay .
i think they tied up with a lot of people .
% uh with the ez-link card , you can buy food as well .
so if you put in a lot of money-
you have to put in money first when you buy the card .
and then when you buy the card , you % um get benefits at certain places .
okay .
okay .
okay .
seve~ even sell them at seven eleven stores .
okay .
like as i said , if you get it at the airport % uh i think they can supply you with a little map to go with it .
so how much is it ?
is it-
ten dollars , twenty dollars ?
let 's see .
okay .
can you see at the bottom of the screen ?
oh yes .
okay .
so it is like twelve dollars -
% uh , twelve dollars , yes .
ten dollars and five dollars , right ?
and % uh-
yes , that 's right .
% uh when you buy it at seven eleven stores , they only charge you ten .
when you buy it at the post office outlets , it 's five dollars .
wow .
that 's a lot of % um discount if i , you know , buy it in singpost -
outlets .
but-
no , it 's the top-up value .
% um you need to put in money on top of this value .
% uh , okay .
so it 's just like a denomination , right ?
okay .
you see ?
that 's right .
yes , that 's right .
so you put in money .
so if you think you 're gon na travel a lot , you can put in more money .
and when you leave at the airport , leave some time to go back to the office and get your refund .
oh okay .
so i can use it and then everytime i use it , right ?
so there will be like-my balance will not be as , you know , like twelve dollars from twelve dollars .
it goes down-
to ten , eight seven -
until there 's not-
you know , there is nothing left , right ?
yes .
yes .
that 's right , yes .
so-
% uh normally at the singpost and seven eleven , they think people are just using it as a convenience .
so it 's a bit cheaper , yah ,
but you can get your balance value so it 's not a problem .
okay .
oh .
okay .
okay .
so far i have my mind set that i 'm gon na take % um a re~ % uh pardon % um moderately-priced hotel .
i 'm gon na go-
to universal studio .
maybe try forest adventure .
go to-
little india and go to along orchard road and rangoon .
is it rangoon ?
serangoon road is little india .
okay .
so-
% uh maybe when you do little india you do chinatown as well .
because they 're both of the same line .
yes .
two stops on the line .
and then when you go to % uh universal studios and the forest adventure you do it on another day .
so % uh that 's what your two days will allow you to do .
if you want more % uh you need to stay about 5 days i think .
then you need to visit-
you can visit attractions like the zoo , the night safari , the bird park .
chinatown , right ?
okay .
and nature reserves .
okay ?
okay .
alright .
sounds good to me .
so i 'm all set up .
so i made up my mind and % um thank you very much for your help .
now if-do you have any additional , right , information that you want to tell me before-
right , i end our call ?
maybe you can-
tell me some more attraction in your country .
oh % ah .
% uh the zoo , the bird park and the night safari are places that tourists normally go to .
and other attractions on sentosa island .
so it 's advisable to stay like five days , right ?
max .
like that so .
yes .
to be able to enjoy it .
at least five days i think .
yes .
and you can spend one day shopping also .
okay .
if i still have money left , i have to go into a lot of places we 've talked about .
i guess right , why not ?
okay .
okay .
that 's okay
alright .
so that 's about it .
so % um perhaps i 'll go to your country and i think it 's a very beautiful country .
and i enjoyed talking to you .
and-
and i look
seeing you mirelle .
i look forward .
% uh me too .
alright .
how old are you ?
if you do n't mind , how old-
how young are you ?
so do come mirelle .
i 'm holding a senior citizens travel pass that 's how-
are you sure ?
no way .
yes .
we only get that when we are-
i think sixty two or something like that .
are you serious ?
yes , i 'm serious , but
i love young people and i 'm interacting with them all the time .
oh you sound very young .
so-
you sound very young .
i ca n't believe it jeanne
miss jeanne that you are holding a senior citizen pass.`
miss jeanne that you are holding a senior citizen pass.`
no way .
thank you very much mirelle , you made my day .
okay .
so do come , okay ?
and really ma~ really five days is what you need .
okay .
five days maximum to be able to enjoy
all the sites and what singapore , you know , has to offer , right ?
so i guess i 'll take five days and i 'll call you again .
but i really enjoyed talking to you .
and i learnt about your country .
a great deal .
okay , so i 'm gon na say goodbye now and i hope to talk to you again soon .
yes .

hi , good afternoon .
hi , good afternoon .
this-
% uh this is % uh tour guide number one ,
and my name is lynnette .
and how may i address you ?
% uh i 'm participant number sixty .
okay , and would i be able to get your name ?
sure , my name is jo .
hi jo .
hi .
it 's yo~
% uh your name is lynnette , is that right ?
yes , that 's right .
lynnette , nice to meet you lynnette .
hi .
okay jo , may-
how may i help you ?
% oh yes % um i like to % uh plan a tour to singapore
% uh some time in i guess mid-august .
% uh that 's when my birthday is .
so i 'd like to know % uh where can i go , what can i do
for about two days .
two days in singapore , % uh ?
yes .
okay .
now , in august actually the first week of august , singapore
is going to celebrate our birthday .
% oh wow , okay .
but that would be mid-august for you ?
yes , % um i actually took a look at the calendar
and about august seventeen , eighteen , nineteen , that sounds about right .
okay .
so that should be % uh saturday , sunday % hm-
no , i 'm sorry .
friday , saturday , sunday if i 'm not mistaken .
and-
friday to sunday , okay .
and % uh what are your
what would you-
what are you thinking of doing here ?
actually % um i 'm not sure , but % uh
i do love the beach .
% uh are there any beaches in singapore or even close by ?
okay , we do have nice beaches on sentosa island .
okay .
% oh i 've heard about sentosa , okay .
so you could do your swimming and other activities
on sentosa island .
% uh we do have also a beach on the mainland singapore
% uh but it 's just a simple beach .
alright .
okay .
okay , and what do you mean by simple beach ?
it 's not like % uh white sands ,
% uh what do you mean by simple beach ?
because % um i 'm actually looking for white sands and very calm seas .
so how are the beaches in sentosa and mainland singapore ?
okay , the mainland of singapore , we have our beach over at the east coast .
% uh yes we do n't have white sand on the east coast beach .
% uh yes , we have pretty deep sea water around the coastline of singapore .
so i would say that is not very calm sea .
okay , so i would think % uh sentosa beaches would be more to your liking
because you have a beautiful beach out there , in fact there are a few .
% uh and also % uh very calm because the waters there are pretty calm .
because you can actually swim inside the lagoon .
okay .
okay .
okay .
% oh okay , right .
so i 'm going to show you % uh the sentosa .
okay .
alright , i 'm gon na just show you sentosa and i 'm just going to show you
some of the beaches we have .
alright .
okay , this is one of them it 's called siloso beach .
and the other beaches would be pahlawan .
okay .
okay , that 's pahlawan coming up .
okay , you can see they are beautiful , right ?
right , it is .
okay , and the other one will be tanjong beach .
wow .
okay , so they are all very nice beaches on % uh sentosa island .
okay , impressive , very good .
okay , this is the one the sentosa beach % uh i 'm talking about , okay ?
so nice % uh clean and calm waters , i think that would suit what you are looking for .
good .
% um is august a good month to go to sentosa ?
how 's the weather like in singapore ?
% uh we have summer the whole year around .
so there is no % uh differences on whether you are coming in january or december ,
% uh in terms of our weather .
just in december the weather gets one degree cooler , that 's all .
just one degree cooler ?
% uh and what about the freak weather storms
like % uh tornados or hurricanes , anything like that in singapore ?
is that common in singapore ?
yes .
% uh no we-
fortunately here we do n't have % uh the natural disaster ,
because we , yah .
we do n't have % uh earthquakes , we do n't have tornados .
% uh what we have here would be just very mild monsoon rain .
or i would say very heavy rains , that 's about it .
wow .
mild monsoon rains .
okay , and what month are those ?
% um okay it 's generally happening in % uh the month of november .
% uh you can still come because % uh although you may have heavy rains ,
the rains do % uh stop , alright , after a short while .
% uh so we do have people coming to singapore from january to december .
november .
alright , good .
% um actually % um i do see the site right now and % um
the beaches on sentosa .
it 's comparable to what famous beach around the world ?
% uh i think we are very different .
our beaches are i would say man-made , alright .
and % uh they are very safe to swim because
% uh you have % uh what we call lagoons .
okay .
lagoons , okay , alright .
yes , so it 's safe to swim in the lagoons
and also in the lagoons itself , you have these buoys .
so as long as you 're just swimming inside the buoys ,
you are actually i would say very safe .
so if you are looking at the safe place % uh to swim and very convenient to the hotels .
% uh that would something that i would recommend .
alright .
actually my main activity when i go to the beaches
% uh is snorkelling .
% uh is the water in sentosa is it good for snorkelling also ?
% uh no , we-
i would not recommend you to go snorkelling in sentosa .
% uh we normally do i would say scuba diving
off % uh the southern islands of singapore .
% oh why not ?
% oh scuba diving .
i 've never gone scuba diving .
% uh it does n't really interest me .
so around sentosa ,
thi~
so this is an island , right ?
sentosa island , okay .
yah .
yes , it 's an island of the southern part of singapore .
alright , and there are no locations for snorkelling ?
% uh no , yah .
we normally would not % uh do snorkelling % uh on sentosa island .
% oh % uh is there a place in singapore where we can go snorkelling ?
% uh like i said no , unfortunately .
but % uh we do more of % uh scuba diving of the off-shores islands of singapore .
okay , would i be able to introduce you to a beach volleyball on the beach ?
no .
% oh wow .
beach volleyball .
because % uh actually i was thinking of going there with my family
and % uh my family really loves snorkelling .
% uh okay , so what else can we do on the beach
% uh besides the usual volleyball , walking on the beach ?
% um so what else ?
okay on sentosa -
so snorkelling is definitely out of the question , right ?
okay .
that 's too bad .
yes .
yes .
so on the sentosa there are so many attractions , alright .
% uh will you be coming with % uh small children or just for adults ?
% oh % uh actually it 's % uh my wife and my son ,
my ten-year-old son
and we all love snorkelling .
but yah if you can tell me a few more things that we can do maybe
% uh you could convince us to go to sentosa .
okay , well % uh i think that the your child would be interested in this % uh
attraction called the butterfly park and insect kingdom .
okay .
% uh and in this small little park , you get to see all this insects .
and part of inside the park itself , you will also be walking through an % uh open-air ,
as you can see , you see the butterflies are just parked .
or % uh they just % uh hang on to the person itself , alright .
okay , so yah and as you can see the scorpion as well .
okay , so these are-
this is a small % uh but very compact butterfly kingdom ,
% uh butterfly park and insect kingdom .
and i think if your son is % uh very much into a little bit more adventurous and a little bit more exciting
or in fact your whole family , yourself and your wife included ,
you could go and do this mega-zip adventure park .
it 's like an obstacle kind of a park , if you can see .
okay , % oh i see .
right .
i see .
so this is also found on the island itself .
so you do n't have to travel , you know , to many areas .
% uh you can do a lot of things just on the island itself , alright ?
so this is one of them and another attraction you would also be interested in this ,
it 's called the skyline luge .
okay .
okay , and what 's that ?
okay , this is like % uh a bit like bumper cars .
% oh sky , okay .
yah , but you are going downslope .
okay , you are going downslope ,
so it 's really exciting % uh if you get on to this luge ,
and you can do a one-way luge and the other way by % uh skyline is the open-air cable car .
kind of a thing , yah .
so these are the some of the games or sport you can do on % uh sentosa itself .
okay .
alright , sounds interesting .
so this is not a resort or is this a resort ?
% uh the whole island is resort .
okay , the whole island of sentosa .
so we have different sections ,
% uh i 've given you some of the attraction that is found on the island where you can do .
okay .
alright .
okay .
okay .
alright ?
% uh of course there are lot more .
% uh you can even climb up or take a ride into the merlion .
okay , and what 's that ?
okay , this merlion is a symbol of singapore .
% uh half lion and half fish tail , okay ?
and , yes , so you can actually do % uh a sort of % uh go inside the lion
and take the lift right up to the mouth of lion
and have good eye view of % uh sentosa and even towards indonesia .
% oh yes .
% oh okay so it 's hollow inside ?
so people can actually go inside .
yes .
yes .
alri~
% um i 'm guessing there is a fee for this , right ?
how much is it ?
okay , the admission into this merlion park is eight dollars for an adult ,
and five dollars for child .
so if your child is ten , yes that would be child rate .
% oh that 's % uh singaporean dollars , right ?
yes , everything will be in singapore dollars .
okay , how much is that in-
% oh what 's the conversion rate for % uh us dollars to singapore dollars ?
% uh one us dollars will give you approximately about a one dollar and twenty seven cents
singapore money .
% oh i see .
okay .
alright .
okay , so this one us dollar will give you approximately about a dollar twenty seven
% uh singapore % uh money , alright ?
so if you want to make things easier , then it 's about a dollar thirty cents .
so one dollar is one twenty five , % uh % huh .
i see .
i see .
okay , i see , alright .
yah but it 's actually less , yah .
it 's about a one point two seven at today 's rate .
okay , alright , good .
okay , so % uh there are other attractions but i will % uh , you know , skip that .
as you can see , right , there are a lot more attraction on % uh sentosa itself .
and of course in the night time , you may want to do a show on sentosa .
sure .
i do .
okay , we have % uh the song of the sea that comes on every night .
% um % hm , the song of the sea ?
yah , it 's call-
is a show , it 's a water laser and fire show .
that comes on in the night time .
the first show is at seven forty and it last about twenty minutes .
okay .
okay .
seven forty , okay .
yah .
so that is the show that you may want to do .
and of course we have a theme park called universal studio on sentosa island .
good for twenty minutes .
yes .
% oh it 's on sentosa island , the universal studios ?
it 's not on the mainland % uh singapore ?
yes .
yes .
% uh no , it 's on the % uh sentosa island .
it 's on sentosa , wow .
okay , so , basically % um when i was researching singapore , and what we can do in singapore ,
% uh the universal studios was i think it was the number one thing to do in singapore .
so i like to know a few more things about % uh universal studios in singapore .
so it is on sentosa island ?
not on the mainland , okay , good .
yes , correct .
not on the mainland , yah .
so there are-
so these are just some of the scenes % uh it 's divided into seven zone .
okay , so these are just some of the scene .
this is one of the rides .
okay .
okay , and of course you can take photographs with the characters .
well we have % uh madagascar .
madagascar , alright .
okay , hollywood area .
i have one question .
% um % uh what-
is the peak season in august or is that low season or the lean season ?
what-
% oh we do n't really have like a peak season .
% uh maybe you get a little bit more crowd in june and december because
that is also our school holidays here in singapore .
% uh and of course some of the public holidays , % um then you get % uh more local people .
otherwise % uh i think it would be fairly % uh ,
it is not like really crowded if you are going into % uh the theme park .
okay .
alright .
okay , so in august % uh so that 's a perfect time to go to singapore ?
wow , okay .
yes .
% uh yah we do n't have major holidays except on the ninth of august ,
that 's our birthday in august .
% oh % uh when is the singapore birthday in august ?
% uh ninth , on the ninth of august .
ninth of august , that 's perfect .
yes .
yes , and we do have a big birthday parade % um % uh in singapore
in the month of august ,
% uh ninth of august .
otherwise % uh the rest of august we do n't have other major festival .
i see .
i see .
i see , alright .
% um is there a big difference-
is it better to go to % uh this theme park on weekday or on weekend ?
i 'm guessing it 's better on a weekday .
% uh yes , % uh of course weekday , then you do n't have to % um have a queue % uh in the-
of course the more popular rides like the transformer rides .
so weekday i would say % uh yes , we get lesser crowd .
but even on weekend it is not like % uh really so crowded
as you have to squeeze-in your way , % uh no , yah .
right .
right .
right % uh mu~
that 's good , because i 've been to % uh
what 's that place called in florida , us ?
% uh universal studio ?
% uh the other one ?
% uh disneyland or dis~ yah , i 've been there .
disneyland .
yah , i 've been there and the queues are-
it 's crazy .
% uh for one ride , it could take about may be twenty to thirty -
may be even to forty five minutes ,
just to get on the rides but it 's not that bad here in % uh universal studio singapore ?
yah , that i would say may be saturday , sunday , yes you do have to queue a bit of time .
% uh maybe the more popular rides would be like transformer ,
yes maybe you do have to queue like fifty minutes over the weekends .
% uh but otherwise , i think it 's manageable .
that 's good news so unless if i 'm going there ,
% um for two days and let say friday , saturday ,
the best time to go to universal studios would be on the friday .
yes , that 's right .
friday and then just go to the beaches on a saturday , okay ?
yes , correct .
and do you want me to recommend your hotel to stay in sentosa island ?
that 's good .
i do , yes .
i see here % uh at the very top ,
% uh this website is for % uh resorts world .
is that right ?
yes .
yes .
% uh there are some hotels % uh just within the universal studio area .
there are some % uh hotels out there , okay .
so you can choose to stay % uh there as well .
alright , they are all relatively new hotels .
okay , % um .
% uh are there any four-star hotels % uh on the island ?
% uh no we do n't have a four-star hotel % um ,
the resort world hotel would be , i would say they are different category of hotel
because they are % uh resorts hotels , right .
% um and
right .
okay , there is one more hotel .
remember earlier on i showed you the beach ?
right .
% uh okay there is % uh resort % uh hotel called the rasa sentosa .
okay .
the rasa sentosa .
yah , and it is actually the same chain as the % uh shangri-la hotel .
% oh i see .
so it 's the same chain of hotel , shangri-la and the rasa sentosa resort .
yah , but it 's a different kind of category of hotel .
this is resort .
okay , so this one i can recommend you % um this would be
% uh the hotel out on % uh the island .
so maybe you can stay % uh one night out there .
okay .
i see it's-
okay .
sure , is this beachfront or is this in the-
is this in land ?
% uh it 's a beachfront hotel .
beachfront hotel , alright .
can i see some of the % uh location ?
% uh no % uh maybe the rooms later .
yah , the location .
i wan na see what 's around this hotel or this resort .
the rooms ?
% oh the location ?
okay the location .
okay , just-
if you-
now you are looking at the % uh
this is the back of the re~
% uh sentosa resort .
% uh in the front area you-
it overlooks the siloso beach .
okay .
yah , remember just now i showed you the siloso beach ?
% oh yes , okay .
yes , so it actually overlooks the beach .
and it 's quite a pretty % uh hotel .
i see .
okay and it's-
and the hotel is walking distance from the beach , right ?
yes , it 's just next to the beach .
% oh it 's right on the beach , that 's good .
yah , right on the beach , yes .
so it 's a beachfront hotel .
okay , so this is % uh rasa sentosa hotel .
that 's good .
okay .
and what are the rates like for this hotel ?
% eh i-
okay , i will show you the rates .
and i guess we can do % uh
we can probably book hypothetically for august % uh seventeen to eighteen
just to see if they have available rooms on that-
yah let 's see whether they have % uh , okay .
so you planning to tour august seventeen to august % uh eighteen .
alright , let see whether-
right .
okay there will be two adults and one child .
okay , so it will show the rates .
okay .
% oh yes , it 's available % um-
okay , yah .
so it is a friday .
% oh that 's good .
yah the rates % uh would be singapor dollars
% uh four hundred and ten dollars per night .
okay .
it 's not bad .
yah and it right on the beach , okay .
so you could stay one night on the resort and the next day you can go over to the mainland .
right .
okay .
right and % um yes if we do % uh decide to got the mainland ,
% uh what can we do there ?
because i always thought that universal studios was on the mainland .
% oh okay , no it-
yah , that's-
so that 's why i was planning to go to the mainland .
but now your telling me that it 's actually on sentosa island .
so now if we go the mainland , what can we do there ?
what can we see ?
alright .
okay , what do your wife , yourself and your child like to see ?
i guess % um if % uh actually sentosa would be probably for me and for my son .
but if we go the mainland , i guess that will be for my wife .
and she likes to shop , so where can we to go shopping ?
alright .
okay , we had lots of shopping options in singapore .
% um even the locals like to shop and eat , alright .
so % hm a lot of us goes to this road called orchard road to do our shopping .
okay .
alright , i 've heard of that .
and , yes .
and you can-
you are actually looking at one of our % uh newer shopping centre called ion on orchard road .
if you look at the map below , you see the pink highlighted area ?
that is orchard road .
it 's one straight road .
okay .
alright .
alright and , yes again you see some of the % uh street seen in orchard road , alright ?
full of greenery mature trees and every other building would be % uh a shopping centre , a hotel ,
dining area on orchard road itself .
% oh i see .
okay ?
yes , and what would-
what does she likes to shop for ?
what do you think she will like to shop for ?
she actually likes to go to bargain shops .
and i see here that % uh we have pretty high-end shops on orchard road % uh , right ?
% uh are there any places here or roads where they have bargain like for shops or the market ?
% uh we do n't really call our shops market here .
% uh but just on the junction of this building % uh ion ,
% uh beside the main road is orchard road , the other road is scotts road .
so if you just walk down , % uh you will come to this shopping mall called the % um % uh far east shopping centre .
okay , now this sell % uh the i would say the budget and mid-range kind of products
% uh that ranges from hair accessories , % uh ear accessories , right up to fashion and shoes .
so that is one option that you may wan na consider .
all these shops are just one shop , so they do n't really have chain shops .
% uh so it 's not like the high fashion .
% uh the other place that i would like to recommend % uh for the cheaper options of shopping
would be bugis , alright .
% uh so this is an area , another area again it 's the shopping mall .
% uh i mean next to the bugis mrt train station , if you look on your right-hand side .
% uh you can , yah .
yah , you can see bugis junction .
okay , so there is a red building just a five minutes from the mrt ,
% uh and again there are all tiny shops .
% uh so if you want to talk about market then , maybe that would be quite similar to what you are talking about .
% uh so there are no branded items there , basically they are just % uh fashionable wear .
so this is the other shopping option .
% uh would you and your son like to look at any of our war museum federal ?
far east .
okay .
okay .
that 's good .
% um % uh war museums .
not too much war museums , but if you have any science museums or a technology museums .
my son is more interested in science actually .
okay .
so i would be able to recommend he-
% uh you a science centre which a lot of school children , they like to go to this % uh place call the science centre .
okay , so this is % uh a visit to the science centre and it 's quite interactive as well .
% uh again it 's very accessible .
you can take the subway again , the mrt , and goes towards the western part of singapore .
so this is the science centre , and your son will ,
well , enjoy like a few hours % uh in this science centre itself , alright .
so i 'm going to show you like what are the exhibitions .
okay in here there are all very interactive .
okay , inside here .
okay so some of these are permanent exhibitions and they are always there all the time .
but of course at certain time of the year , they have different focus .
so it 's really very interactive , very % um stimulating actually for children as well as for adult .
that 's good .
okay .
i see .
it looks pretty interesting .
% um how much is the entrance fee to this science centre ?
hello .
yes .
okay , i 'm giving you the rates .
okay , yah .
alright .
okay , let me just-
% um actually you mention a lot of trips % uh via the mrt .
% uh is it fairly simple to take the mrt to different locations or-
yes , % uh it is very simple to take the % uh mrt .
okay , and there are some english signs there , right ?
that i can understand .
yes , there are % uh signs are all written in english .
so it 's actually very easy to get by .
% uh we have just % uh a few line , alright , at the east-west line and of course the reverse direction ,
that is the green colour line .
and north-south line will be in red colour .
% uh and % uh north-east line % uh that would be a purple colour .
and a second line that is in yellow .
okay .
good .
that 's good .
okay .
okay .
% oh so it 's very organised , that 's good .
yes .
so % uh and of course it always go in reverse direction , yah .
so very easy to take the % uh subway , our mrt .
right .
okay , that 's good .
and every-
yah , so-
and % uh most of the shops the locations and things to go to ,
it is accessible via the mrt , is that right ?
yes .
alright , and how much will it cost me to take the mrt in one direction ?
okay , our mrt is charge as well based on % uh distance travel .
okay .
alright ?
so let 's say if you 're in the east , you want to travel down to let say orchard road ,
that would be a cost of % uh approximately about two dollars .
two dollars ?
two dollars and twenty cents singapore dollars .
% uh , yah so you-
since you 're only going to spend like two days , i would just recommend you to buy % uh like the standard ticket .
okay .
% uh , the standard ticket and what 's that ?
is that like an all-day pass ?
% uh no .
you just buy like a per trip basis .
per trip .
% uh is there % uh a ticket like an all-day where i can use that
and i can go anywhere i want % uh with that ticket , no ?
% uh we have like % uh not the one day pass ,
% uh but we have like a tourist pass .
so because i do n't think you 're going to travel that much ,
so i think it is cheaper if you just buy % uh per trip basis .
per trip basis , okay .
yes .
okay , so , yah ea~
your earlier question like how much does it cost in science , nine dollars % uh for-
yes , nine dollars the admission .
% uh for child up to sixteen years , that would be five dollars .
right .
nine dollars .
five dollars for three to six , okay .
yes .
yah .
so that 's eighteen for five , twenty three , okay .
not bad .
yah .
yah and of course we do have like a four d kind of a show .
% uh again it depends on what show it 's gon na show in august .
% uh that 's like in a three hundred sixty degrees kind of facility theatre .
i see .
alright , and that 's not included in the entrance fee , right ?
% uh no , that 's an additional of ten dollars .
additional ten dollars and it 's seven dollars for kids .
three to twelve years old .
yah .
yes .
but there is option , huh , whether you want to see this show or not .
otherwise % uh-
i see .
yah .
alright .
so basically % um i 'm actually % uh off the top of my head .
i 'm calculating how much i would need
if i were to go to singapore % uh for two days .
% uh and going back to the resort hotel ,
% uh if i remember correctly it was around four hundred fifty dollars , is that right ?
yes , correct .
and that 's per night ?
okay and % um that does n't include the dinner or
breakfast , lunch and dinner .
% uh no , normally our hotels would include the breakfast .
% oh it would include the breakfast ?
yes .
% oh i see , that 's good .
so i would just have to worry about the lunch and the dinner for my-
for myself and for my family .
okay .
alright .
yes .
correct .
so like for if you 're spending the whole day on sentosa island , % uh or in universal studio ,
there are meals , there are dining options available out there .
% oh okay .
okay , so you could have like a just simple meal % um
like a sandwich or something in the park .
and for dinner options , % uh because % uh you 'll be spending % uh quite a fair amount
on your hotel stay .
so maybe i can recommend you % uh to do like our street food .
% oh is % uh % um are street food is available on sentosa island ?
% uh yes we do have a food court % uh located on sentosa island .
% uh for a meal with drink , let 's say a main course with a drink
that would cost you approximately about ten dollars .
okay , ten dollars per person .
per person .
yah ten singapore dollars per person .
alright , and this % uh food court on sentosa island ,
% uh they serve street food just like on the mainland ?
yes , so you can have like % uh fried hokkien noodles ,
% uh a fried carrot cake , alright , satay .
satay , yah i 've heard of that .
% uh that first one you mention , fried carrot cake , is that right ?
yes .
yes , fried carrot cake .
what 's that ?
is that for breakfast ?
is that like desert ?
what is that ?
yah .
% ah okay , yah .
our fried be~
% uh carrot cake version is very different from % uh the american fried % uh carrot cake or the european versions .
% uh this is a savoury % uh kind of egg with white radish .
alright .
white radish .
yes , it 's actually white radish that has been grated % uh and with rice flour .
so it 's cooked like a little bit-
some of them cook it like pancake style .
so it 's the savoury and we can eat it for breakfast , lunch or dinner .
breakfast , lunch or dinner .
so the whole day ?
yah , it 's actually quite filling , yah .
so that is something that is % uh i think not found in your country .
so you may want to try that .
wow .
yah , i think we do .
actually % um one of our things that we do is % uh we try to taste
as many of the street or the local foods as possible .
and i think this fried carrot cake would be one of them , if we do decide to go to singapore .
anything else that we can try ?
anything exotic or % uh maybe challenging to try ?
yah .
challenging , okay , eating with your hands would be like either the chili crabs or % uh pepper crabs ,
this will be challenging .
or if you really want something very exotic ,
% uh we do take % uh the turtle soup in singapore .
yah .
% oh okay .
turtle soup .
yes .
but again not many % um % uh not many % uh food court will offer this option .
so you would be able to find them in chinatown for this particular dish .
if you are talking about very exotic food .
i see .
okay and % uh what else can we expect % uh from the street food , yah ?
% uh we do have-
from the street food i think it will be like satay at % uh
at the satay club over at old % uh lau pa sat .
% um % hm , okay and what 's that ?
okay , and that is-
okay , what is satay ?
satay is marinated meat % uh cooked-
% uh pierced with skewers and it 's cooked over charcoal .
okay .
alright .
okay , so that is satay .
alright .
and if things get a bit too maybe strange for my son ,
% uh my son really likes fast food .
is there % uh-
what are the fast food restaurants available in singapore ?
okay , the fast food that is available here would ranges from mcdonalds ,
% uh mcdonalds right up to wendy 's , kfc .
okay .
okay .
okay , so , yah .
this would be some of the % uh fast food that we have here .
alright .
alright , pretty standard and stuff , okay .
alright so % um i 'm guessing % uh with the accommodations , % uh with the food and the entrance fees ,
% uh maybe around seven to may be eight hundred dollars , us dollars .
is a good amount of money to have % uh as a budget ?
okay , that 's good .
so it's-
yes .
% uh yes .
yah .
because if you are going to stay in a % uh i would say % uh % um % uh above-
let say about three to four hundred dollars stay in the res~
% uh in the hotel , then you could actually % um of course
take a chance to % uh taste all our local food , our street food in full .
right .
okay , sounds interesting .
okay , so % uh besides-
let see , anything else ?
yah , this is what i 'm going to show you is claypot rice .
yes , what is this ?
yah , okay .
it 's a rice cooked in a claypot , so you get this aroma and of course
% uh most of the time % uh they have either-
you can ask for seafood or chinese sausage or chicken % uh
% um in this dish , alright ?
it 's like one pot meal .
yah , so this is another food that you may want to try .
% oh so there is rice underneath and it 's % uh cooked along with the meat ?
yah meat and % uh a bit of % uh vegetables .
and this is only for four dollars ?
% uh yes % uh in the non-air-conditioned food centre .
% oh that 's fi~
% oh what is the average temperature in singapore ?
yah .
% uh average temperature in the afternoon % uh ranges from about thirty degrees to thirty two degrees
% uh any time of the year .
% uh in the mor~
in the evening from let say eight o'clock onwards ,
% uh the temperature will go down to twenty six degrees
right up to the morning % uh about seven o'clock in the morning .
yah , so we do n't have drastic change of temperature .
% oh that 's good .
so the open air is just fine .
yes .
alright and this restaurant is on bugis , bugis street or bugis what is that ?
% ah okay .
this bugis remember earlier on i also introduce to % uh like a no brand kind of a shopping ?
right .
orchid road .
right .
alright , so in all our shopping centre , there 's always % uh air-conditioned food court .
% uh but the bugis one it 's open air , so you can-
of course try this food , it is sold in either % uh air-condition food centre
or non-air-conditioned food centre .
the non-air-condition % uh food centre would be ,
the prices would be a little bit cheaper .
so let say you could get it for four dollars and if you 're going to have % uh your-
the same kind of food in air-condition % uh food centre , then you pay about six dollars .
okay .
i see , alright .
% oh i have one more very important questions .
% um my family and i went to india % uh maybe a few years back .
and the water there was not very % uh potable .
ri~
when we actually drink water there , we got sick .
so % uh i guess , i 'm guessing , that singapore does not have that problem , is that right ?
right .
% oh n~
yes , our water here is very clean .
so if you do n't really have % uh very weak stomach ,
we can actually drink directly from the tap .
% uh but of course again , you are not so sure
whether your stomach can take it or not .
then of course i still recommend you to take the boiled water
or yes or bottled water .
but otherwise our tap water is very clean % uh in singapore .
okay .
right .
bottled water .
okay .
it 's fine , alright .
because we try that in india and it was a bad idea .
so thank you .
yes .
yah , so % eh once you turn on the tap , you get clean water .
clean water .
and that goes for all the hotels , all the % uh establishments
in % uh sentosa and also on the mainland , is that right ?
yes .
yes , you get clean water throughout % uh all the areas in singapore .
i see .
that 's good .
alright , lynnette % uh thank you very much .
i think i got everything that i need .
and % uh based on this conversation with you , i think i think we will plan
a trip to singapore some time really soon .
yah .
pleasure .
yes , we hope to see you soon then .
so-
so thank you very much .
okay , welcome .
bye .
okay , bye .
hello .

okay .
well good afternoon jeanne .
and % um i 'm planning to have % uh not only a tour
but i 'm planning to % um spend my summer in singapore
maybe two nights or two days .
i 'm not really sure .
maybe two days .
but-
yah , huh .
two-
yes .
% uh two days would be one night .
i think you mean three days and two nights .
oh i think two days and one night .
okay .
two days , one night !
only one night .
just a-
hold o~
i 'm not sure yet .
yah maybe you can help me out later
if it 's going to be one night or two nights .
okay .
alright .
yes .
okay .
but % um i 've heard so many good things about it
but i do n't really know anything about singapore .
so maybe you can help me out ?
you have n't been to singapore before then ?
nope .
i have n't .
may i ask your age group ?
are you twenty to thirty ?
thirty to forty ?
forty to-
oh you can make a good guess .
i 'm just kidding .
% uh i 'm % um turning twenty six this year .
twenty plus ?
oh twenty six , that 's very young .
yes .
are you travelling with someone ?
% um , oh i have n't really thought about that .
but maybe me and % um i think i 'm bringing a friend .
so that makes it two of us , yes .
a friend .
okay .
so you can share .
you can get a twin room , right ?
% um % hm , a twin room .
i 'm not sure .
which is really good .
how much would that be ?
twi~
twin is separate beds and % uh-
% uh twin and double is the same .
is just that whether you have-
you want to squeeze-in one big bed
or you want to have your own tiny bed .
% uh huh .
% uh huh , that 's right .
but not really tiny , but what i mean is single bed .
some people do n't like to sleep with other people
because they toss and turn and bash them up
in their sleep .
% uh huh .
oh yes , that 's a good point .
okay , well , % um i 'm on a limited budget .
% uh i actually have a thousand dollars -
singaporean dollars to spend for that trip .
so can i afford a really nice room for me instead ?
yah .
okay .
ok~
oh yes .
if you are staying just one night ,
you have a good choices % uh for % uh that one night .
well , i 'm not really particular about a five-star hotel .
% uh i just want the amenities to be there like the-
% hm well , what kind of amenities do i need ?
% uh ac , % um i should have my own bathroom ,
% uh what else ?
% um a fridge in the room , stuff like that .
not-
i do n't need the kitchen i think .
i just need % uh not really a big room
but not a very % uh how to say not a very small
enough for me to walk around
but not , you know , bump on the bed or somewhere there .
something like that .
but not really fancy .
i mean-
yes .
so-
three-star you say ?
then you have a lot of money left over
for only a thousand dollars .
oh really ?
oh okay .
huh .
a three-star hotel .
yes .
just a minute .
% uh huh .
okay .
alright .
the hotels would all have air conditioning in singapore .
okay .
and % uh what you want is attached bathroom and you want a fridge .
% uh we also have
% uh okay , we have a list here .
% uh huh .
% um % hm , i want-
alright .
yah but if you can get me a room with a really good view
that would be nice .
a good view ?
yes .
well , if i look out my window ,
i do n't wan na see another wall or another person 's room .
i want not really a spectacular view but % uh a view that 's not a brick wall
or not a-
yes .
not a view of the busy cars or buses on the street .
yes , something really nice .
something that you do n't see every day .
okay .
i 've got you this hotel .
it 's called gallery hotel .
% uh huh .
% um % hm , sounds fancy .
okay .
are you getting it on your screen ?
yes , i 'm seeing gallery hotel right now .
can you see the picture at the top ?
yah , what is that ?
% uh that 's the view .
you 're looking at singapore river .
and that 's part of the theatres on the bay .
% uh huh .
% uh you ca n't quite see here .
but on the right side of that picture
% uh some of the tall buildings in the business district .
so it 's really a nice view .
and your hotel ,
look at it on your right .
% uh huh .
on my right ?
oh that's-
oh yes .
can you see ?
it is a sort of art piece with the different colours .
oh right .
it does n't look like a hotel to me .
yes .
it 's pretty nice .
ex~
exactly .
and it 's right by the singapore river .
so if you like to walk around in the evenings or even early morning ,
it 's a very nice place .
okay , will that fit my budget ?
let me see here .
let 's see the facilities that they have .
yes .
you 've got internet interactive .
oh yes , i forgot to mention that .
wi-fi will be really nice .
% uh connectivity .
yes .
okay .
you have tv with remote cable .
tea and coffee making facility , hair dryer .
bathroom amenities .
they even give you your own bathrobe and bedroom slippers .
oh very nice .
and you can get a laptop workstation .
but i do n't think you want to work on one day , do you ?
that 's right .
yes , thanks .
okay , but % um % hm do you have pictures of the rooms in this hotel ?
pardon ?
are there pictures of the rooms in this hotel ?
let me see if they are pictures of-
yes , i hope they do .
they should have .
okay , because if i will be staying for only one night ,
i wan na make that night really comfortable .
okay , i 'm looking for more images here .
okay .
% ah , yah .
from the outside of the building ,
it looks really nice , yes .
looks like a museum or some sort of , yah .
or maybe a department store , no ?
% uh there are shops nearby .
you actually very near to chinatown across the river .
do shopping and you could walk around % uh in the evening .
have meals there .
is it safe there ?
yes , safe .
very safe .
okay .
oh there .
what is that part of the hotel ?
you have the swimming pool .
i think this is the dining area , the middle picture .
so it 's very good class .
i do n't know why they call themselves three-star .
the lobby is here .
it 's not big in size .
but it 's in a good location .
i guess so .
% um % hm , that 's right .
yes .
i think the view is really nice .
and you said that it will fit my budget okay .
yes and it~
let me see % uh-
you see , okay .
do you see the room view now ?
oh yes .
oh that 's a pretty nice wall art .
yah .
yah .
okay .
yes , with that lady there , right ?
% uh huh .
that 's very nice .
yes .
oh that would be perfect .
alright .
well i 'm staying for a one night or maybe two nights at the most .
% hm but during the day , yes .
i 'd like to try out some things of course food would be number one .
and then of course i would like to take pictures of myself all over singapore .
so what would be the best places to visit ?
for food first .
o~
okay .
% uh wait .
just let me give you the rates first .
did you ask me for the rate just now ?
oh yes .
alright .
yes , i forgot about the rates already .
okay , yah .
and you were asking me about the mer~
% um about % uh the places around .
do you see the picture of what looks like a lion there ?
% uh huh .
oh yes .
that is also within walking % uh distance from your hotel .
% uh you walk along the river
and % uh you will reach it in no time .
that 's right .
and behind is a first class hotel , the fullerton hotel .
oh .
oh okay .
fullerton , alright .
and there 's also a museum nearby .
that 's great .
so i 'm waiting for the rates to appear right now .
% uh huh .
oh okay , that 's really nice .
it 's nice to walk around the river .
is that what you said ?
yes , that is right .
okay .
because in case you come by yourself , you know ,
% um these places are within walking distance .
it 's also the historic area
% uh with many colonial buildings from the time when we were under the british .
and-
yah .
% um hm .
oh .
bring your camera and take lots of photos .
yes , i probably do that .
but from the airport ,
how do i get to the hotel ?
% uh just-
alright .
yah .
let me-
just now the room rates .
just a minute , huh .
okay .
well , i 'd like to have a feel of-
okay .
alright .
so-
yes .
just have a look at your room rates first .
% uh huh .
oh where is it ?
okay , there .
it say single with breakfast is two two seven .
twin with breakfast is also two two seven .
oh .
okay .
alright .
pretty okay .
this is for one night , right ?
yes , one night .
for one night .
two two-
oh okay .
gallery-
i 'll probably take gallery twin or double .
oh they are the same rate .
so either one is okay . alright two three eight is that .
so either one is okay . alright two three eight is that .
that's-
that-
% uh huh .
that 's okay , right ?
yah .
okay .
now , you were asking me about-
% uh what was your next question ?
% uh huh .
% uh how do i get to the hotel from the airport ?
okay .
let me get to the mass rapid transit .
yes .
i 'm thinking % uh the fastest % uh way to get to the hotel
or maybe how i can move about the city
, you know , without much hassle .
is it-
without much hassle i would say take-
i mean traffic , yah .
you take the train which is the fastest .
any traffic jams , % uh it 's not affected by it .
yes .
alright .
% uh when i get lost in there 'cause i 'm pretty bad with directions .
so-
no , you would n't get lost
because the signage is very good .
and at the station when you arrive at the airport ,
you will get a help from the station master or the officer % uh at the station .
% uh huh .
oh okay .
so-
so let me show you where you are .
this is the map of the southern part of singapore .
and if you-
are you getting the map ?
% uh huh .
yes , i can see the map .
can you see on the right-hand side
number three in green ?
% uh yes .
number three .
that is where the airport is .
yes .
oh okay .
so if you go down to the basement when you arrive
and buy a transit ticket ,
i 'll tell you more about it later .
% uh first you change some money and then you buy your transit ticket with a card .
and % uh you can use the card ,
you top it up with money and use the card .
before you go back you provide time to get a refund on the unused portion .
okay .
% ah okay .
they just hold back a little bit for the manufacture of the card .
that is all .
okay , you travel along the green line .
and you come to the-
let me see .
you go down to outram park .
can you see the purple line ?
where the green hits the purple right at the bottom .
yes , % um % hm .
yah as-
% um % hm , yes .
so you switch to the north line
and you are at chinatown .
% uh huh .
and-
okay .
if you go to the next stop clarke quay ,
that 's very near to your hotel .
and if you , yes .
clarke quay is where you get off and you have to-
you may have to walk across the river .
they do n't show the
oh !
the river there , okay .
the bridges across the river .
but it 's very nice .
it 's very pleasant walk .
i 've done it just for fun myself .
% uh huh .
okay .
okay , well , if you say so .
okay , i 'll take your word for it .
alright .
yes that's-
yes .
okay .
so why did n't the-
why do the airport their the terminal or station for the train already .
so and-
yes , there 's a train station there in the basement .
and you can see it branching off , right ?
there 's number one there .
yes .
so what they have done is they have split it
so that you have to take it only to tanah merah
and then you take the westbound line .
% uh huh .
you make sure you switch on the westbound or else
you 'll end up in another part of town called pasir ris .
which is also fun .
is a holiday area , it 's near the sea .
oh alright .
so if i get lost , that would be okay too .
oh % um .
yes that would be okay .
% uh but the signs are very clear .
and if you ask anybody there ,
most of them are working at the airport .
they will direct you to the right direction .
% uh huh .
okay .
alright .
so now i know how to ge~
go to the hotel from the airport .
alright , now , let 's go to food .
alright .
% uh i 'm not % uh very
how do i say this ?
i 'm not very % uh much of the-
i 'm not into trying out vary dishes to me .
so i want to eat singaporean food but not % um-
% hm , well not that really exquisite ones .
i just wan na try the simple dishes for singapore .
okay .
the simple food is it ?
yes , simple ones first .
% uh you do n't want to try like at the market or % um you do n't want to-
so is your stomach delicate or-
oh .
thank you for asking .
% uh i 'm quite allergic to crustaceans , to shrimps and , yah .
to those , yes .
but seafood , only shrimps and crabs
but everything else is okay .
oh you are lucky .
shrimps and crabs are quite expensive .
crabs especially .
they are not so cheap in singapore
% uh because singaporeans love it .
oh really ?
okay .
great .
so if you go the food courts in the singapore ,
you-
the good thing is you can actually see what you are eating .
i can actually see , oh !
yah , because they cook right in front of you .
oh that would be great .
and also i want the ambiance to be really nice
'cause i 'll be-
yah .
okay .
% uh then i suggest you eat near your hotel ,
since you do n't have much time .
near my hotel , oh .
% uh i believe that for lunch they were having a fifteen dollar promotion .
i have noticed that all the restaurants were having that promotion ,
so you could have your choice of italian , western , asian ,
% uh that 's for lunch .
dinner it 's a different story ,
because that is a nice place to be at .
so the dinner prices go up quite a bit .
and-
% uh huh .
oh okay .
yah .
well for lunch , is that buffet style ?
% uh no , usually it 's a set meal .
and they stipulate what you are eating .
so % um you are sort of told exactly what you are going to eat ,
exist .
oh .
oh i see .
up and via singapore .
okay .
something that you might want to try in singapore .
oh .
we 've got these restaurants here .
% uh but they are % uh not in your location .
but i 'm trying to look for a dish .
okay .
it 's okay if i have to travel a little bit ,
'cause i want to do some exploration too
but maybe not too far
'cause i might get lost .
but a place where in % hm not too crowded
'cause i want to enjoy my meal .
so i want a place that serve really good food and then-
okay .
okay , this place is good .
it's-
let me try and get it for you .
it 's called crystal jade
and it 's at holland .
% uh holland % uh is not name after the country ,
it 's named after an architect .
oh yah .
okay .
% uh you can take the train and % uh you will % uh end-up at holland just nearby
and you can just walk here .
and this place is called crystal jade .
they have a chain of restaurants all over .
i think so , yah .
but holland has got % uh nice ambiance also
so you might want to walk around there .
okay , what about inside the restaurant ?
is it nice inside ?
yes , it 's nice , it 's simple
but it 's nice .
it 's not posh ,
so it wo n't break your bank .
but it serves % uh better than average chinese food i think .
oh chinese is good , yah .
% uh do you know this dish xiao long bao ?
it is a little dumpling .
oh i think so .
% uh i-
it 's sound familiar .
yah steamed and it 's actually got a bit of soup inside the dumpling
which is unusual .
% ah yes , i 've heard of it .
i have n't really tried it though .
so you see the prices here ?
spending twenty one dollars to thirty dollars .
is that % uh cheap or okay ?
okay , a cheap meal at the food centre % uh simple noodles would be only three dollars .
so if you have two plates , six dollars .
so this is more expensive than that .
and more than the fifteen dollar set meal that you get
down by the river where you are .
yah .
okay .
well , twenty one , yah , maybe % hm-
% uh i 'm not sure .
but are there other places that i can-
if you want indian food ?
do you want indi~
indian food , oh yes .
indian food could be nice .
wait , let me get you-
can like grills and % um kebabs , yes .
yes , % uh-
they also have it there ?
there 's a place-
there 's a place called race course road in singapore .
located where there used to be a real race course in the early days .
oh i see .
and there are full of indian restaurants there .
okay i 'm just gon na go-
okay .
yes .
indian restaurants .
race course road restaurants in singapore .
okay .
so here we have a list of them .
is that far from the hotel ?
% uh on the northeast line , % uh there 's a stop right at little india .
so , when you get off the train station ,
you just walk .
% uh huh .
so we have the chinatown and then this one is little india .
and~
yes , that is right .
okay alright .
and these are the major restaurants there .
banana leaf , i go there myself .
% um banana leaf means you actually eat off a clean banana leaf .
oh i see .
that's-
% hm i 'm not sure if i wan na eat in a-
on a banana leaf .
% hm but is the food good ?
% uh is-
the food is good .
it 's also hot , if you like hot food .
yes , i like that .
but you see here they have north indian and they have south indian .
so if you do n't go for too much hot food ,
you can go for the north indian .
oh there 's a difference ?
oh i did n't know that .
yes .
south indian food cuisine is quite hot .
chili hot .
okay .
chili hot , okay .
and the north indian is milder .
is got spices but it is not so burning on the tongue .
% uh huh .
okay .
wow .
good advice .
and we have something called fish head curry .
have you-
heard of it ?
fish head curry ?
curry , yah , i 've heard of curry .
but not fish head curry .
they got-
they get the head of a big fish
and they cook curry with % uh tomato
and lady 's fingers and a little bit of tamarind ,
so it 's slightly sourish .
and it 's the favourite of the locals here .
and then ?
oh i see .
okay .
we 'll % uh i 'm into desserts and sweets too .
i 've heard of % uh chewy junior
'cause we have that here already .
and i heard from some of my friends that you also have it in singapore .
chewy , what do you call it ?
% uh the chewy junior .
ch~
chewy junior , let me see .
yes , i think there are cream puffs .
oh !
have you heard of it ?
% uh no but we have similar things .
% uh huh .
there , do you see junior-
but i got it here junior singapore .
yes , the fi~
i think that 's the first one .
yes , chewy junior singapore .
now i 'm learning something from you .
it 's at bugis junction .
% uh yes , the-
it 's also on the train .
oh it 's also on the train .
oh great .
yah the bugis is % uh one of the stops of on the east-west line .
say vanilla cream , cream puffs , doughnuts .
that 's right .
yes , and it's-
so you could also shop there if you want that whole area-
oh i can shop there ?
% uh huh .
yes , and % uh-
what can i buy there at that area ?
% uh there is a lane there that you can shop .
it 's in this bugis area right across the road .
you can see there 's a small lane and they have lots of little stalls on either side .
so if you are looking-
% um is that like a flea market of some sort ?
% uh if you could-
yah i guess you could call it a flea market .
% uh huh .
a bit more organised than a flea market .
oh okay .
% uh huh .
where is it again to , jeanne ?
it 's right on the train station ?
and-
the train station is called bugis .
bugis is the name of the
% uh one of the peoples from indonesia that came over and settle there
% uh two hundred years ago .
bugis , okay .
bugis .
oh and then it's-
the train station is named after them , okay .
yes , but they are no longer , you know ?
they 've inherit-
they 've inter-married with the local malays and they have-
the people have-
the malays have merely moved out to the eastern side .
so this is like a major shopping area ,
there are offices there as well .
there ?
% uh huh .
okay .
well , you mentioned shopping .
i 've heard that , yes , there % um like accessories and clothes and shoes .
% uh as you 've known % uh i 'm on a tight budget ,
so i have like % uh a really i 'm spending three hundred dollars for shopping .
a little bit of accessories and maybe some shoes .
do you think i can buy things with three hundred dollars ?
yes , you can buy lots of things .
at bugis there is a big shopping centre
% uh it 's called bhg .
bhg , okay .
what is that stand for ?
it stands for be here for good .
because they took over the store
from another store that closed .
okay .
so i 'm not joking .
it 's true .
oh ? !
oh okay .
be here for good , alright .
yah .
but the~
nobody knows-
i mean not-
very few people bother what is about .
so you got ta look for bhg and it 's at the bugis station .
and like i said across the road where that little alley is ,
the bugis lane
you can look for lots of funky clothes , you might like them .
% uh t-shirts and things , shoes .
% uh huh .
have you shopped there ?
yes , you can buy a lot of things there .
% uh huh .
and if i-
there you-
if i wan na buy a souvenirs ,
so that i can bring them home with me .
where can i get really nice souvenirs ?
you can get them there .
and also walk to chinatown from your hotel .
and when you 're at little india , if you go a little bit earlier ,
for your dinner ,
you go across the road to little india arcade
and you can get lots of souvenirs there too .
% uh huh .
oh right .
well so far % uh i've-
i 'm seldom where i'm-
going to stay the hotel how to get to the hotel from the airport , food and shopping .
but that 's not a pretty nice vacation .
so i 'm thinking of doing some activities ,
but i have no idea what to do
and usually , yah .
what do you suggest i do ?
okay i 'm put up-
find you some % uh i-
what are you interested in ?
% uh huh .
% hm i like watching-
no .
movies , i can do that at home .
% um % hm maybe watch a show .
but not movies , not a place .
what exactly-
you 're talking about a live show ?
maybe performances , yes .
something like that .
performances ?
okay .
i think i forgot .
well , if you are open-dated about your arrival
% uh i would recommend that you go-
i put the wrong the spelling .
just a minute .
we have a lovely theatre
by the river and it 's also within walking distance of your hotel .
it 's called the theatres on the bay .
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
theatres on the bay .
what do they showcase there ?
there are two major theatres and smaller studios .
% uh wait .
let me get it , the ticketing .
% uh huh .
so there are concerts and there are also % uh shows % um sort of-
during the different periods of time
like during chinese new year ,
we have more chinese themed concerts .
during the indian festival time they have indian musicians coming and indian concerts .
% uh let me see .
so you 're talking about show , i 'll go to the theatres on the bay
and see if i can-
a calendar .
i like % uh maybe singers or % hm magic shows
those kinds of stuff .
% uh magic shows -
sorry .
it 's something that you ca n't see every day or you ca n't watch every day
or something that you ca n't catch easily on tv or in the internet ,
i 'm not sure .
oh .
okay .
yah , just something to , yah .
do on an evening before maybe-
or after you have taken your dinner .
% ah okay .
something that 's nice to do before you sleep .
something like that .
theatres .
ther~
okay , just give me a moment to get back there .
i 'm trying to get to their programme section .
okay .
is it expensive though ?
% uh it depends on the type of show .
if it 's an international artist you are watching ,
then it 's expensive .
oh .
but if it 's % uh something not so-
somebody not so well-known or high profile
then it 's a little bit better .
a little bit better .
% uh huh .
okay .
just let me-
sure .
okay , well , that 's one i can think of right now .
but actually i have no idea of what i want to do when i get there instead
% uh aside from eating and having a tour in the city .
but af~
because you are staying one day and it is a bit limited .
oh .
yah , you know .
so how many days should i stay
to have a good % um feel in singapore ?
i think five days is good .
five days ?
oh i do n't have that much time .
yes , then you go-
% uh we have good shows at marina bay sands
that 's where one of the casinos is .
% uh but-
% uh huh , a casino .
yah , good .
you know the casino theatre ?
a casino theatre , okay .
i have n't seen any shows in a casino theatre .
but casinos are nice .
yes .
okay .
% uh you do n't have to gamble there if you are just seeing the show .
okay .
but if i 'm staying for two days and one night only ,
what am i supposed to see or where am i supposed to go
if i visit singapore
to make my trip complete ?
what are the % hm main attractions ?
if you like heritage
then little india and % uh chinatown
% uh to walk around it 's very exciting .
and then to try some of the local food .
and then in evening you might want to % uh go and see the shows
what the one show .
yah .
the show at night .
okay .
well , i 'd like-
i 'd like to take some photos of myself all over the place .
so where are good spots where i can take photos ?
by the river just outside your hotel .
just outside the hotel ?
yes and walk down the river towards the bay
where the merlion is .
merlion .
oh it 's right there .
yah the merlion .
have you heard of the merlion ?
yes .
why is that a symbol of singapore by the way ?
it 's a-
it is a symbol for the singapore tourism board originally
% uh because a prince that came to singapore thought he saw an animal
and he was wondering what it was .
and someone told him it 's a lion .
but we have no lions in singapore .
no records of lions .
so we think he saw perhaps a tiger or a big deer
and because we are a % uh , you know , we are an island
and we were a fishing village
and now we are an international sea port ,
so we have the mer for mermaid and for the sea .
and then the lion for the what the prince thought he saw .
so we have the top and the bottom joined together .
and-
oh .
okay , you see-
do you see the singapore river ?
ye~
oh that 's it , okay .
yes , i can see it .
so your hotel is nearby here
where you see river valley road on the top left .
okay , in that vicinity is your hotel .
it 's a very pleasant walk down the river
and you can-
cross the road and get on to the north side .
you will be passing bars and eating places along the way .
and you can take lots of photos of yourself .
right on the edge is the merlion park .
% um i see .
and you can get lots of tourists or tour guides to help you take photos there .
okay .
well , the hotel sounds like it 's very nice .
but if i-
for example i want to stay at a-
like a small house .
sorry , again ?
if the hotel sounds really nice ,
but if i would like to stay in a small house ,
can i rent one for a day ?
% uh huh .
a house for a day ?
% um , i am not sure about that .
renting a house for one day % uh , i am not sure .
i ca n't confirm that .
but you can rent a room in % uh places that 's % uh are for expats
settling into singapore .
do you know what i mean ?
wait .
% um , hold on .
no , it 's okay .
i 'm sorry .
hello jeanne , i 'm sorry .
yes , my throat got suddenly itchy .
% uh huh .
% uh yah , you having a cough , huh ?
yah .
but anyway , okay .
i-
% hm the hotels sounds nice , okay .
but % hm and it seems like everything is quite within the vicinity , okay .
so i think that 's really good .
that would be enough for my trip .
okay , then .
i 'm glad .
i hope you will think about staying five days and not just one day .
oh yah .
i would love to stay there for five days
but , yah , i ca n't afford that much % uh , yah .
longer vacation .
okay .
% uh huh .
but yah , thank you .
thanks for the help .
your welcome .
but i do n't think you can a rent house for one day .
okay , i 'll bear that in mind .
okay .
thank you .
ac~
you said if you go to the , you know ,
when i told you , you take the wrong journey from the airport ,
there 's a holiday % um-
there are holiday bungalows that you can rent .
% uh there are actually for parties for one night .
so % uh usually people rent them to throw a wild party ,
away from where people live , okay .
oh !
okay , thank you for that .
alright .
welcome .
alright .
bye .
thank you , jeanne .
bye .
bye .
oh my god .
hello .
hello , good afternoon .
hello , good afternoon .
my name is jeanne .
how are you ?
i 'm okay , i 'm fine .
what about you , miss jeanne ?
i 'm fine too .
yes , jeanne .
what is your name please ?
% um i 'm participant nineteen .
my name is euke .
yuki .
yuki , y u k i ?
yes .
% uh not the-
the spelling is not y u k i but e u k e .
oh .
yes , it's-
e u k e , okay that's-
yes , it 's a different spelling of the name euke .
% uh it 's very original .
yes , it sounds unique .
% hm , yes .
how can i help you euke ?
oh by the way , i 'm planning to have a
trip to singapore with my girlfriend
this coming the fourth until the sixth of april .
okay , fourth to the sixth of april .
but-
but i do n't know where to go .
i have n't been to singapore yet .
% uh may i know are you both in your twenties or thirties ?
% uh yes .
we do .
okay .
% uh what is your budget for coming ?
i only have one thousand singaporean dollar in my pocket .
is that for both of you or for just-
no , for-
just for me , just for myself .
for yourself % uh-
so do you mind if you go to a budget hotel ?
% uh it 's fine as long as it 's affordable .
and it goes with my budget .
okay .
okay .
and you can take public transport around singapore .
we have got very good % uh transportation system by rail .
mass rapid transit and also by buses .
% uh they 're all air conditioned .
okay .
so your thousand dollars could % uh very well % uh be enough for the both of you .
it 's just for the land arrangement , right ?
oh .
% uh % hm that 's cool .
oh by the way , how much is the airfare from the philippines to singapore ?
airfare , i think there are various airlines % um .
you might want to-
can you travel on cebu air ?
are you able to from where you are ?
yes .
you mean cebu pacific ?
yes , that 's right .
alright .
so how much would it cost for me to go to singapore ?
okay .
i 'm on the cebu pacific website now or rather i 'm trying to get on to it .
alright .
% uh it would be a round trip ticket .
it 's origin would be-
is it manila ?
manila .
yes .
from manila to singapore .
a round trip ticket .
i prefer a round trip ticket .
manila and your destination is singapore .
yes .
okay .
and departure date is the fourth of april .
yes , it is the fourth of april .
until the sixth of-
okay .
yah .
april , yes .
until the sixth .
okay , just give me a moment .
alright .
take your time .
oh by the way ma'am what 's your religion ?
i 'm a catholic .
oh you 're a catholic .
is it-
are you too ?
many of my filipino friends are .
yes , i-
yes .
i am catholic too but i do n't think if there are catholic churches in singapore .
oh there are plenty .
in fact % uh ninety per cent of our choir members are catholic .
okay .
oh
so that 's better .
so we depend on them to sing for us .
% uh okay .
yes .
oh by the way , from-
let 's say for example , i already arrived in singapore airline-
% uh airport .
will you pick me up at the airport ?
oh from the airport , you can easily take the mass rapid transit that we call the mrt .
% uh huh
and you can come to singapore from there .
% uh alright .
you mean to say that % uh there is no tourist guide that will accompany me
from the time we arrived at the airport ?
% uh you-
there are .
you can but you know you have a limited budget .
if you get a guide to pick you up and send you to town by limousine and all that , it will be expensive .
it 's very easy to do a free and easy % uh by yourself when you arrived .
alright .
so how much if i add-
how much-
what if i add % um two thousand singaporean dollar for my budget ?
% uh would it be-
your two thousand dollars , if you 're just staying a few days , you could get a car to pick you up from the airport .
oh so you mean to say that if i have
three thousand singaporean dollar in my pocket , there is a tourist guide that will pick me up at the airport ?
but let-
yes , you can be picked up from the airport .
you can do all your tours privately .
okay , i think that's-
% uh but let me get back to your % uh question about the fare .
alright .
you see it there ?
april the fourth on your screen ?
cebu pacific air .
from manila to singapore .
alright .
so those are all the flights .
and % uh unfortunately because maybe it 's so close to the date-
yes .
% um the promotional fares are not available but i can see here
six thousand nine hundred and ninety nine dollars .
yes , okay .
% uh for filipino peso , i do n't know how that got % uh
how that connects .
% uh what 's the-
yes .
the conversion .
you mean the conversion , you do n't know the conversation ?
yes .
yah , conversion .
yes , % um
% uh i think it 's around two thousand or more than two thousand singaporean dollar ,
the value of that .
for the fare ?
yes .
oh that 's high .
yes , i think it is .
but it 's fine but-
because i really want to travel .
i really want to go to singapore because i want to see how beautiful it is .
% uh what part of singapore are you think-
what are your interests ?
actually i 'm into-
i love animals so i wan na go to the zoo if there is .
okay .
oh which is the best zoo in singapore ?
we have only one zoo in singapore .
alright .
and it 's part of an organisation-
called % uh wildlife reserves .
wildlife reserve , is that right ?
so-
yes , that 's right .
and you can visit the zoo in the day .
and then walk to the night safari which is just next door .
and you can visit the night safari to see the nocturnal animals .
let me get on their website , huh ?
how much is the fee ?
just a minute .
yes .
how much is the fee at the zoo ?
% uh if you buy a ticket for all the attractions , it 's much cheaper .
alright .
okay .
how far will i go with a thousand singaporean dollar in my pocket ?
% uh it 's % uh it depends on where you stay .
if you do n't spend a lot on your % uh hotel accommodation
you 'll be able to visit a lot of places .
i can go anywhere with that-
with a thousand dollars ?
yes , you can get hotels about a hundred over dollars .
you can get hotels at a thousand over dollars .
so-
% um if you save on the accommodation , then you have more money to visit attractions .
okay .
so how-
and % uh if you do n't take the taxis and you do n't hire a private guide , then you use public transport , you save a lot of money .
alright .
so for example you will tour me , alright ?
so you will be my tour guide because i do n't know anything about your culture , your customs .
so i might get lost also
because i think it 's a big country .
however if you will tour me in singapore , how many hours per day will you be with me ?
you have n't been around-
you have n't been to singapore before , right ?
how-
yes .
so normally we do a city tour where we bring you to the ethnic areas .
% uh like chinatown , little india .
and the malay quarter if you like where we have an old mosque .
and these are the heritage areas where the buildings are conserved for future generations to enjoy .
we would also bring you to the historic area by the singapore river .
where we have % um the merlion which is the symbol of singapore .
okay .
and you can in fact take a riverboat ride in the bay .
it 's very scenic and it 's very good for photography .
so on the tour , we would tell you things about singapore like the population .
% uh that we have a mixed culture of chinese , malays and indians we have .
alright .
so-
buddhist , christians oh .
yah , we 're there .
you tour me in different places in singapore .
can i took pictures or are we allowed to take pictures ?
yes , i think it 's only in the airport that it is % uh restricted .
% uh so usually you can take pictures .
it 's just that if you are in a place of worship like a temple or a mosque % um it 's better to ask for permission
from somebody who seems to be in charge .
alright .
so that you know , officially you 've got permission .
% uh usually we do n't take pictures of people who are praying but of the architecture .
okay .
but do you have do 's and don'ts for a tourist like me ?
% uh i beg your pardon ?
% uh do you have any do 's or don'ts for a tourist like me ?
% uh okay .
% uh do 's or don'ts % um generally you do n't smoke where there 's a non-smoking area like in the restaurant .
okay .
they have only a certain part of the place where you can smoke .
de~
there 's a designated area and it says that you can smoke .
so it 's limited to a very small percentage of the total area of the restaurant .
alright , can-
for example i brought my phone with me and then
can i use my phone while we were sort of touring or touring like with % uh-
% uh sorry , you want to use your phone while you are touring , you can .
okay .
but you ca n't use-
if you hired a car , you ca n't use your phone and % uh drive at the same time .
you know what i mean ?
i think it 's more fine .
yah .
okay , what is the best travel secret you can divulge to me ?
travel secret .
yes .
% uh i say get a train pass and then google for places when you 're in singapore
and pick up the tourist brochures on arrival when you are at the airport .
alright .
so that even if you do n't have a computer you can look at the brochures and you can have a quick look at what you like and do n't like .
and then we have % uh people at the airport that can tell you how you can get there .
okay .
% uh if that will save you a lot of money because you do n't have to hire a cab .
you do n't have to actually hire me as a guide .
% uh huh .
or private car because hiring someone privately will cost you more money .
alright , so-
because i think that once i get in where i book for a trip to singapore , you will tour me there .
% uh so it shows to me that it happens
in a different way .
you-
% uh you can plan it also before you go .
let me try and get these parks for you .
it was a bit slow downloading .
% uh , yes .
for the wildlife reserves , right ?
because i really do love animals .
actually here in the philippines , i went to different zoos .
yah .
% uh huh .
yes .
there is a package ticket .
i think it 's about forty five dollars or forty dollars that you can pay
to visit the bird park or the zoo and the night safari .
and because you are , you know , short of time-
% uh you-
i suggest that you visit the bird park on one day at the same day that you do your city tour or-
you know you travel-
you can travel by yourself to little india-
and the ma~
actually it 's affordable .
i can see here that the tour rate for-
or in the zoo is only eighteen dollars .
yes , that 's right .
yes , it is .
but you see the three in one special there ?
can you see ?
it 's fifty eight dollars and you visit all three .
oh , wow .
% uh i think i will
my girlfriend and i would prefer % uh three in one-
yah .
you-
tour in the safari .
the night safari and the zoo are located next to each other .
okay .
and you just walk across the car park .
so you can visit the zoo in the afternoon .
at the same time ?
yes , and then walk across the night safari .
and then if you 're energetic and you want to have one whole day for something else-
yes .
you could go to the bird park first in the morning .
yah , alright .
because % uh this is my plan on our first day
we 'll go to the zoo .
so here 's the thing % uh i will be for the three in one package .
% uh because zoo is in singapore so it 's only fifty eight dollars .
so
but % eh
could you speak a bit louder please ?
% uh alright .
alright % uh-
okay .
so here is my plan .
i-
on the first day , we decided to go to the zoo .
so i prefer to take the three in one package -
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
in-
of the zoo .
so in the morning , we 'll go to jurong bird park % um in the afternoon -
% uh i ca n't hear you .
hello .
yes .
i can guess you said morning you 're going to the bird park .
yes .
afternoon to the zoo and the night safari in the evening .
yes , in the evening .
yes , i think it 's affordable .
then on the second day , because i really love the sea , i wan na go swimming right there .
nice beaches in singapore .
is that right ?
yes .
% uh okay , i lose you now and then .
but-
hello .
yes , okay .
i 'm getting you now .
alright .
% uh i sugg~
okay .
so when you go to the bird park , you buy the three in one ticket .
now-
yes .
% uh normally i think you have a month to use it up .
but you can use it up within a day , it 's not a problem .
% uh if you are tired by the time you reached the night safari or the zoo , you can take a tram ride .
but it 's really nice to walk around these places .
and you just have to remember to keep your three in one ticket the minute you buy it .
okay , so i will take note of that .
% um and then i think if-
because it 's a big day .
% uh huh .
you see , we will go into the bird park in the morning .
the singapore zoo in the afternoon .
night safari in the evening .
so for sure we will be-
% uh huh .
% uh i 'm losing you .
hungry .
hello .
% uh yes .
oh you 're okay , you are back .
alright .
so for sure we will be hungry on that time .
alright .
now , where in your place-
where 's the best place to have dinner around singapore ?
yes .
% uh actually if you are going to walk from the zoo to the night safari
you will have a limited choice of places to eat . you-
you will have a limited choice of places to eat . you-
i suggest you eat inside the night safari .
oh there are restaurants inside the night safari ?
restaurants .
yes then .
yes , there are restaurants and there are like burger places if you do n't want to eat a full meal .
okay .
because to do the three in one , you are a little bit limited in time .
so what-
oh yes .
so you might want to leave your eating for the next day .
oh what about if we bring-
what about if we bring food while % um roaming the zoo or the park , are we allowed to do it ?
yes , you are allowed to do it .
% uh we have also fast food outside so if you want to buy and-
bring-
while you 're walking around the zoo , you nibble on the food , it 's fine .
it 's okay if we bring the food that we buy in the fast food restaurant .
so it 's fine to bring it inside .
it 's fine , it 's not a problem .
% uh it 's just that you should be aware that you should n't leave litter around .
alright .
so it 's one of the prohibitions in your country that we do n't have to litter anywhere , right ?
yes .
you should try and keep our places clean
and usually people do adhere to that rule .
so what if i do n't know any rules about that ?
i 'm throwing pieces of litter every-
anywhere ?
usually the places , there are signs to remind you not to litter
and usually it 's at places where you eat .
% uh so that you are mindful and there will be lots of bins around for you .
% uh alright .
yes , because it's-
actually we-
i am aware that singapore is the cleanest city in the world .
% uh well one of the cleanest cities .
i wo n't say it is the cleanest .
% uh we do have a lot of cleaners to pick up after ourselves actually .
% eh yes , it is .
yes .
and oh by the way , on the second day-
yah .
i prefer to go to the beach .
so-
okay .
would you-
you want to go to the beach ?
would you mind to look for nice beaches in your country ?
i think one of the nicest beaches is on sentosa .
sentosa .
it is an island .
alright .
and this beach actually has a filipino name , it 's siloso beach .
oh .
siloso means jealous , right ? or jealousy .
siloso means jealous , right ? or jealousy .
yes % uh-
% uh actually it 's % uh it 's spa~
siloso .
yah , jealousy .
it 's spanish time , siloso .
jealousy , yah .
% uh i see .
we are not sure how that name came about .
% uh but we do have % uh very good views here , i 'll show you , of the beach .
there you go .
if you get into the island % uh there 's no charge for swimming except if you use the lockers .
that 's all .
alright .
wow , it 's a very nice place .
yeah .
oh it has white sand .
yes , very good .
% uh and the-
you know it 's safe .
it is % uh-
i think it 's very romantic when i-
when we go there .
yes , indeed it is very romantic .
and % uh you can also stay until the night time .
we have bus -
and restaurants there .
but if you do n't want to spend so much money , there are also % uh food stalls or rather shops that sell food that is not very expensive .
alright , so how much is a one day stay in that beach ?
the beach , when you enter the island , it 's a two dollar charge .
okay .
and another dollar for public bus .
upon entering is two dollars ?
yes .
and one dollar if you take the public bus in which i suspect you will need to after on your visit to all the parks you 'll be a bit tired .
% uh huh .
yes .
% uh and then on the beach , it 's free .
but i 'm asking if the beach is free ?
free , yes it 's free .
what about the cottage ?
so if we will rent the cottage ?
so-
how much would it cost ?
oh-
we do n't have a cottage .
we usually just set up a place underneath the coconut tree or % uh some people even just-
oh .
% uh hang out at where the food places are .
oh really so that 's how you do it ?
yes , because we-
it 's , you know , it 's very open .
it 's cool and breezy .
% uh maybe if the sun is out , it 's a bit warm .
so we try and hide under the shelter of some trees .
alright , because i thought it 's % um sentosa is a resort .
yah , there are resort hotels there .
but usually for the resort hotels , you stay in the hotels -
yes .
overnight .
yes , for-
what about if we stay there for an-
we stay overnight there
so how much would it cost ?
you would have to stay at the hotels .
yes .
% uh that would burst your budget a little bit .
a little bit ?
% uh yes .
the hotels are a few hundred dollars .
alright .
% uh it 's okay .
a few hundred dollars .
% uh then you might want to stay at the nice hotels there and you can just come out and swim .
that 's fine .
it includes accommodation , right ?
% uh yes , i mean if you 're checking in to the hotels , you are staying at the hotels on sentosa .
you are staying
on the island in the hotels .
okay .
so then after that , so we 're done with the second day .
we will go to the beach , so here 's the thing on the third day .
i really love literature , so i love reading books .
books . you want to go to the museum or you want to buy books ?
books . you want to go to the museum or you want to buy books ?
yes .
% uh yes .
i want to go to the museum if there is any .
% uh did you say museum % uh on books ?
did i hear books ?
is that right , huh ?
no , i-
what i said was i love reading books so-
and i 'm into literature so i want to go to museum and-
% uh okay .
yes .
and i want to look for beautiful artefacts -
okay .
regard-
about your country .
oh there ?
okay , are you getting the resort now ?
yes .
so these are the hotels that are available on the ho~
on the island
so that 's quite different from a budget hotel .
right ?
the other end .
so it's-
how much would it cost for-
upon arriving ?
let me-
let me try to get it for you , huh .
april-
the fourth .
on the fourth you 're coming in .
right ?
on the fourth ?
% uh the fifth .
no .
on the fifth .
is that-
sorry , i thought it 's the fourth .
it 's the fifth , is it ?
yes , because on the fourth we will go to the zoo , right ?
no , but if you want to stay at the hotel , do n't you want to stay-
you mean you want to change hotels ?
% uh it 's fine if we arrived there on the fourth .
it 's okay .
so the fourth is the first day then ?
yes , until sixth .
alright .
okay .
and % uh you are departing on the ?
sixth .
sixth huh ?
yes .
after we go to the museum .
okay .
okay , that 's two adults , huh ?
so yes .
so let 's see if it 's available first .
you may not want to go anywhere once you stay in this hotel .
oh yes .
because it 's well-ventilated and the scenes are-
the scenes outside are really nice
so i prefer to stay rather than roaming around .
it 's really-
yes , that 's right .
so okay , these are the rates at the moment .
which is actually quite attractive , five hundred and seventy dollars .
oh it 's fine .
so it 's two eight five a day .
yes .
actually it 's % uh-
it 's affordable .
oh .
oh it's-
yah , it 's affordable .
yes , correct .
it 's affordable .
it 's affordable .
yes , it is .
for a resort hotel , i think it 's very affordable .
yes .
oh alright so i think % um i will choose that , the resort in sentosa .
i 'll stay there for 3 days .
and you wanted a museum , right ?
yes .
i give you one of our nice museums .
% uh it 's the asian civilisations museum .
alright , could you tell me % eh something about the history of singapore ?
we-
well , we have been-
for years % uh thought of as a-
just a fishing village until the british came-
okay .
% uh in 1819 .
and % uh we became a colony
until 1942 when the japanese arrived and occupied singapore until 1945 .
but recent archaeological diggings have found that in fact there was trade here over a thousand years ago .
i see .
oh i see .
so we do have an earlier history that we are not very % uh familiar with
because of the lack of written history .
in china , there are some records .
okay .
alright .
now , what 's the best delicacy in singapore ?
% um are you thinking of chinese or-
indian ?
or the famous-
what 's the famous cuisine ?
% um chicken rice is quite famous .
it 's the rice -
the chicken is cooked in-
boiled in soup .
and some of the-
or rather the water of the soup for boiling the chicken is used for cooking the rice .
and a little bit of oil is added .
so the rice is fragrant and it 's oily and we put in the pandan 's leaf .
i think you 're familiar with that .
it has a-
nice fragrance .
rice huh .
i-
yes .
but-
% uh so you mean to say that to prepare it % um a chef would prefer to mix it all together
the rice and the chicken ?
% uh he cooks the chicken and then he cook-
he takes out the chicken and he cooks the rice separately % uh with the stock that he 's used to cook the chicken .
so you-
alright , so what happened to the meat of the chicken ?
so when you order % uh he will chop up the portion you like
whether it 's the thigh , the wing or the breast .
% um so is there a sauce ?
yes , there is-
is there a sauce where i can dip it ?
there 's a thick % uh good quality black sauce , chinese black sauce .
and there are some restaurants that you give % uh grated ginger .
and chili .
the chili has got vinegar .
so maybe not if you 're with your girlfriend , it might be a bit stinky after that .
okay .
now , is there a restaurant which offers filipino cuisine ?
% uh there are restaurants .
there 's one in the east coast .
% uh a place called east coast road .
and if you come on % uh saturday , sunday % uh most filipinos are at the place called lucky plaza .
and there on the fourth or fifth floor , there are % uh places selling filipino food .
but i would n't categorise them as being restaurants .
% uh because they are more the filipino people so it 's quite affordable prices .
so there is no restaurants which is owned by a filipino and caters filipino cuisine ?
these places , they are i think owned by filipinos and % uh
it 's just that they 're not high-end , you get what i mean ?
% uh yes .
yes .
% uh and-
well i personally know of people who get filipinos to cook for their parties .
very good food % um filipino food .
and they just do it on a personal basis but they charge for it .
alright then i 'm also into movies so % uh do you have-
what 's this ?
actors or actresses , singaporean celebrities ?
oh .
do you also have-
do you also have like that ?
so-
wait .
% uh wait .
can i just show you the museums first ?
because you 're asking me the website that has come out here .
so we have-
% uh in the museums , we also have sometimes temporary exhibits from other countries % uh that come in .
like we have textiles , do you see here ?
% uh yes .
yes , i do .
from india and-
let me see .
that 's up to june so it will be here when you are here .
and we have tank shipwreck gold and ceramic , you see what i mean ?
alright .
yes .
the shipwreck that was found off indonesia has got a lot of items there
that shows that there 's trade in this region % uh that passed through singapore .
alright .
so you mean to say when we arrived there
and we go to the museum , we will be able to see the-
some artefact from india and china ?
yes .
and the permanent exhibits , we also have artefacts from india .
that 's the permanent .
the ones you see here are special exhibitions that are here for a short period only
so they 're very special .
oh % uh % hm .
% uh so i-
but i think we wo n't be able to-
oh yes , i-
we still be able to watch the tank shipwreck and then the patterns of indian .
yes .
much as the trade of india .
yes , you can .
yes .
so will be-
aside from these special exhibitions , what other artefacts would we see or would be seen in the museum ?
it's-
% uh there is one with art and craft from sarawak jewellery % uh and % uh bas~ woven clothings that the villagers used to make .
% uh part of the exhibit is on loan from a collector
who went into the jungle and bought up the items .
alright .
that 's one of my favourite places also .
and we have another museum , this one is called peranakan
okay .
% uh this is an exceptional culture .
it 's a mix of chinese and malay .
alright , now i 'm gon na ask you % um are you single ?
% uh no , i 'm married .
oh you 're married , alright .
now i think % um you are the best person to ask .
yes % uh % hm .
oh where do you usually go with your husband ?
oh we sometimes walk along the bay , you know , by the singapore river .
okay .
and then we stop and have a sandwich or have ice cream .
there are lots of joints along the singapore river .
so it 's very relaxing .
and i-
and i think that should be more romantic
while walking along the bay with your husband while holding hands , right ?
i think that is romantic .
i prefer that it would be very romantic instead of
% uh going to the zoo % um watching artefacts in the museum or swimming on the swimming in the beach .
i think i prefer that one , walking along the bay % hm .
% uh % hm % uh huh
huh % uh yes .
% uh you could visit the earlier museum -
how do i get there ?
museum i told you , the asian civilisations museum .
that is-
% uh huh .
yes .
right by the river .
oh it is ?
so-
yes .
% uh so if you have time and you want to squeeze in two museums
i suggest you go to the peranakan and then the asian civilisations .
and then in the evening , you could walk by the river .
so it 's cooler , it 's very nice .
% uh huh .
so from the-
what 's the name of the museum again ?
asian civilisations .
the one where you see the tank exhibits .
pardon .
% uh okay , asian civilisation museum .
alright .
so from the asian civilisation museum , how do i get to the river-
singapore river ?
when you come out , you 're looking at it .
when you come out of the museum , you 're looking at the river .
oh i will be able to see it at once ?
yes that 's right .
and you can also see the merlion but the merlion is crowded with tourists
so if you walk the other way % uh you cross the river , you walk down there .
% uh what do you mean the merlion ?
the merlion is the emblem of singapore % uh tourism .
oh it 's the landmark .
you mean the landmark ?
% uh that 's the-
that 's right .
the one that 's half-fishtail and half-lion 's head .
that 's at the mouth of the river .
yes , and it-
it has % uh what 's this ?
it is-
there is a water flowing on its mouth ?
yes , that 's right .
% uh that 's also a nice place to walk , it 's just that it 's not very quiet .
it's-
you can see the bay , you can see % um the marina bay sands hotel which has become very iconic .
% uh lovely views that are very % uh attractive for courting couples .
i often see a lot of them there .
% hm that 's good .
and % uh it 's a long day of travel i guess or a vacation so % uh
would-
could you bring me or could you send me to the finest restaurant in singapore ?
oh .
the finest restaurants .
you could go to the % uh swissotel the stamford .
okay .
and it 's also within the area , you go to the top of the hotel .
swissotel ?
yah , the stamford .
it 's used to be called the westin stamford .
and right at the top where you get very good views .
it 's a restaurant .
oh i see .
okay .
you could also stay there if you wanted to .
okay , if you look at the map here .
can you see the map ?
% uh where you see this dot is the hotel .
and your museum is just a little bit further down .
just down here and that 's the river here .
that 's the bay .
% uh the little blue patch on your right .
oh i see .
yes , i can see it .
% um marina frometan , is that right ?
pardon .
marina promenade ?
yes , that 's right .
so let me see if they have the hotel -
the restaurant here .
how much is the taxi fare to this ?
% uh taxi fare , you mean from where ?
from the hotel , is that-
to ?
from the hotel to the museum .
oh % uh which hotel did you say you wanted to stay at ?
% uh the one on the hotel -
at % uh sentosa , right ?
% uh yah , sentosa .
the hotel in-
from-
in sentosa .
the hotel would ac~
we 'll stay there .
the hotel would actually have a % uh shuttle into town .
oh-
oh they do , so s~
% um i 'm not sure if they stop you right there but where this-
where swissotel is % uh they have-
you see-
can you see the restaurant now on your screen ?
yah .
% uh yes i do .
it 's quite % um-
wow , i can see the view outside .
yah .
yes , lovely , is n't it ?
it is .
indeed .
and they also have convention facilities .
wow .
yes .
but-
so as you mentioned earlier , the hotel in sentosa has a shuttle .
but you don't-
you are not sure if the shuttle drops off % um in the museum , right ?
so-
it have .
they may if you ask the concierge .
they might be able to accommodate you .
but i know they will drop off in the town area like orchard road and also where there 's dining places .
because these are major areas % uh for shopping .
so % um is the travel fare for the shuttle included in the hotel accommodation ?
the shuttle % uh to get into the hotel is just one dollar .
yes , what i mean is-
% uh to-
into the hotel .
% uh huh .
the accommodation in the sentosa resort is % um
five hundred eighty singaporean dollars , right ?
so does it include the shuttle fare ?
i-
no , i do n't think they bring you right to the hotel .
you would have to pay extra for the shuttles .
the transfer-
you 're talking about transfer from the hotel , right ?
you are talking about from the hotel when you arrived at the airport ?
% uh yes .
no , it will not include .
okay .
how far would i get there % um-
how far would i get to sentosa hotel from the airport ?
you can get to just across the island at % uh harbourfront .
so how many minutes would it take ?
by the public transport , maybe forty minutes .
forty ?
yah , forty minutes .
around one hour ?
forty minutes .
yes or-
yah , that 's because you have to make a change and i 'm % uh putting in extra for you asking for directions and all that .
it would be less than one hour .
oh i see .
alright , but as you mentioned all the fares in zoo , the hotel accommodation , for the hotel accommodation and then the museum
i think i can go far with the one thousand singaporean dollar i have in my pocket .
yes , you will go very far
because you 're staying only two nights .
% uh but % uh-
yes .
% uh you might have to top-up a bit for your expensive dinner .
yes of course .
% um yeah .
% uh of course .
but for the tour itself , i prefer to-
i have % um a thousand singaporean dollar budget for-
just the-
for the tour .
% uh % uh excluding the food allowance or the air fare ?
% uh okay .
so only for the travel itself .
i think from the % uh what i mean is only for the tour itself .
% uh a thousand dollar -
singaporean dollar is enough .
yes , it 's enough .
yes , it 's more than enough .
yes .
yes .
and-
because as you mentioned that i can enter the zoo for around
sixty five to seventy five singaporean dollars , right ?
yes .
for-
yah , that 's for three-
all three attractions , the zoo , the bird park and the night safari .
for tour attractions , it 's a little over forty dollars i think .
yes .
yes .
yah , it 's okay .
but % um i prefer to go for the three attractions in the zoo .
and then for the museum , i think it wo n't cost much .
no , it 's % uh very cheap .
you go on the next day in the morning free and easy after you wake up .
so-
yes .
because it 's a public
% uh what 's this ?
building so it 's a public architecture so it's-
i think for free .
% uh no , it 's not for free .
you will have to pay
% uh it depends if there is a special exhibit on , i believe it 's eight dollars or so .
oh yah .
so it 's still very cheap .
alright .
if you 're a senior citizen , you get a lot of discounts but you 're not .
yes .
but however i 'm not singaporean .
% uh what 's this ?
my nationality is not singaporean so-
oh no , it 's okay .
even if you 're a foreigner , you get the discount .
yah .
i need to pay for that .
oh really .
but-
yes .
i think it wo n't cost me much .
no , not much .
alright , so before-
% uh so after our tour % uh will you-
what 's this ?
will you go with us to the airport after the three-day tour ?
% uh if you hire my services , you have to pay for my services .
but like i said
you could % uh easily find your way to the airport and just check in .
yes .
alright .
it's-
well singapore is very safe , you do n't really need % uh for a departure .
alright .
for a guide .
because i was thinking that i will-
i 'll be needing a tourist guide and he will show me in this place or this or that .
so i can go all by myself .
yes you can but of course you can also hire the services of a guide .
% uh % hm okay , i understand .
alright , so i think i got all the information i need .
so it 's nice to meet you miss jeanne , is it-
am i right ?
yes euke .
alright .
but i keep thinking i 'm speaking to a japanese .
japanese ?
no i 'm not .
i 'm not a japanese .
because of the euke .
no .
% uh yes .
i know .
you do n't sound japanese .
i really hope to see you with your girlfriend in singapore .
yes , i do n't .

for about two to three days with my wife .
i need to % uh , you know , take her on a short vacation .
is this your first trip to singapore ?
yes , this will be my first trip to singapore and i 'm % uh excited to go there .
so first things first , i % uh want to % uh check on the budget friendly hotels .
so if you can recommend some hotels that i can afford .
% uh what would be % uh the price range that you are talking about ?
okay , maybe i can give you % uh indication of the hotel prices here .
it 's % uh let say about a hundred fifty right to two hundred dollars
or two hundred to three hundred dollars budget range .
yes , maybe % uh if i would be staying for around two to three days .
yes , we have % uh-
so which price range are we talking about ?
the hundred % uh and fifty to two hundred or slightly above two hundred to three hundred price range ?
yes , something around a hundred to one hundred fifty a day .
okay .
okay % uh and would you like something right in the heart of the shopping belt
or you do n't or you prefer something in % uh the residential area in singapore ?
i would prefer something like in the commercial district
where i can walk around and % uh take a look at the sceneries and , you know .
% uh just walking from one place to another would be good .
and , yup .
okay .
walking from one place to another ?
yah .
okay .
so commercial district meaning % um more towards the shopping belt rather than the business district , right ?
yah .
okay .
% um there are some interesting hotels there .
okay , % uh one of the hotels that i would be able to recommend you % uh would be the rendezvous hotel .
rendezvous hotel .
yah .
so how much % uh they % uh
what is the price for this hotel , is it ?
yah , how much are the % uh-
okay , we are looking approximately about just slightly over two hundred dollars .
the prices for-
% hm that 's quite expensive , but i can % uh consider that one .
rendezvous hotel .
yah , because it 's just walking to most of the % uh places .
so it 's in the heart of the singapore commercial district ?
yes , it is .
otherwise there is another hotel % uh call the grand park hotel .
okay .
grand park hotel , so i can also check on this one .
what are the rates for the grand park hotel ?
i 've s~
sorry , the price range is around two hundred .
yah .
two hun~
slightly below two hundred a night .
two hundred a day ?
% uh yes .
so that would-
this will be there % uh regular suites .
% uh yes , % uh a standard room .
alright .
a standard room % uh for one room .
alright , yah , so this is the price range % uh for the hotel .
alright .
and if there is a nearby restaurants within that hotel ,
so if you could recommend some good restaurants like selling singaporean delicacies .
local singaporean delicacy so maybe we could some out of those dishes .
okay , % uh in this hotel itself , % uh they have a restaurant .
okay , they have a restaurant in this particular hotel .
and yes they do serve some of our cuisine .
otherwise i would also recommend to you % uh just about ten minutes ' walk
from the rendezvous hotel ,
% um you 'll be able to get to one fullerton .
one fullerton .
yes and there is a restaurant there that serve a unique singapore % uh food .
one fullerton hotel , alright .
so % uh maybe i can write that down and check on that .
% uh yes , it 's called one fullerton .
alright .
yah , so % uh there is a seafood restaurant
and of course a lot of people , including the locals , like to eat % uh chili crab .
chili crab .
yes .
alright .
what are the other delicacies % uh singapore is known for ?
except for the chili crabs
% oh what other delicacy , is it ?
yah .
okay , because we are multiracial here so we do have like the malay cuisine ,
% uh the chinese , the indian .
and we have another % uh food that is also a favourite of a lot people is called peranakan food .
what 's that again , peranakan ?
food .
food .
yes .
alright .
it 's in-short it will be a chinese style of cooking % uh but using % uh more malay % uh spices .
so do you like spicy food or most singaporean foods are spicy ?
% uh i would n't say most singapore % uh food are spicy it 's
these are just different cuisines % uh that we have
in singapore .
so yes , but yes a lot of % uh singapore people like to eat spicy food .
alright .
alright .
and going back to the hotel , % uh if you could recommend some , you know , local attractions like park
% uh nearby zoos , museums ,
where people , you know , usually go from just walking around or like-
i know singapore is known for their % uh the trains .
yes .
so if you have nearby % uh attractions like what i mention earlier ,
is there any nearby parks , any zoos ?
to-
from the hotel , yah .
the zoo .
from the-
from the hotel ?
yah , from rendezvous hotel .
okay .
from rendezvous hotel , you can % uh walk to-
or i would say either you walk or you take this mrt train from % uh city hall
and you alight at raffles place mrt .
you will be alighting and walking just above five minutes to the % uh marina bay .
okay , so what can i see on % uh marina bay ?
okay , it 's a beautiful bay .
% um you will be able to see % uh the bay front which is very pretty .
% uh and of course the marina bay sands resort , as well as the icon of singapore ,
we call it the merlion park .
% uh the merlion is the % uh ti~
% uh lion head with a fish tail .
okay , so that is the % um good photo % uh stops % uh for you to take some memories of singapore .
so you can do that , just walking distance .
from-
or just % uh one stop away from your hotel .
yes .
alright .
so-
so that 's the marina bay ?
so how many kilometres % uh is that exactly from the rendezvous hotel ?
% uh walking kilometres , approximately about % uh five kilometres .
so i would think % uh taking the train would be a better idea .
alright .
except for marina bay , what else % uh attractions can you recommend for me ?
% uh would you want to see % uh just tourist sports ?
yah , anything that it can be % uh , you know , looking forward to see .
okay .
% uh okay in around the merli~
% uh the marina bay % uh it 's also a wa~
a nice walk because % uh you are just walking around the bay front .
% uh like i said it has interesting skyline , there are some interesting sculptures
% uh along the marina bay area .
% uh and in the night time , % uh we do have a show that is % um ,
you do n't have to pay for this show ,
at the marina bay front .
% uh it 's a laser water show % uh on the marina bay itself .
but that only comes on in the night time .
and there is a very interesting museum on marina bay as well , it 's called the arts and science museum .
yah , i also like to acquire on-
% uh go to some of your museums .
so what is that again ?
what 's
the arts and science museum .
art and science museum , alright .
arts and science museum % uh in the marina bay , okay so-
so-
so it 's inside the marina bay or it 's beyond or it 's just % uh walking distance
from the marina bay itself ?
% uh it is actually just next door .
the % um building itself is shaped like a lotus flower .
okay , now i 'm showing you % uh how this arts and science museum looks like .
it shaped like % uh a lotus flower .
okay , this is the arts and science % uh museum .
so everything dedicated to arts and science and of course at certain time ,
% uh % eh we have special exhibit , alright .
the last exhibit was the % uh titanic exhibition .
and this is actually a world-class exhibition .
yah .
and earlier on you mention % uh you also want to do the zoo as well , right ?
yah , we can also consider % um going to some zoo parks .
alright , the zoo will be located in the northwest of singapore .
% uh and in this zoo , you will see our largest collection of the orang-utan .
well going back to the hotel from the rendezvous hotel ,
yes .
yah , how many kilometres % uh from the hotel to that zoo ?
% uh approximately about twenty kilometres .
so should i take the mrt again ?
yes , you will take the mrt from city hall .
you take the north line and you alight at % uh ang mo kio station .
and from there , % uh you would take a bus to go
okay .
you will go-
yah yes and you take a bus to the % uh zoo .
the singapore zoo ?
yes , this is open in the daytime .
in the daytime only ?
so what time do they usually open ?
okay .
yes .
% uh the park actually opens at eight a.m . in the morning .
and up to what time ?
% uh six p.m .
alright , six p.m .
the singapore zoo .
yes , this is the singapore zoo and you will see % uh mammals in this zoo .
alright , so % uh like i said % uh lots of % uh is-
we have the largest collection of the orang-utans .
% uh there is a show in the zoo % uh that you can watch .
so the show varies from the time of the year or it always frequent the zoo ?
they always have some shows there ?
% uh , no , it goes on every day .
alright , every day we have this show .
% uh in the morning % uh it will be eleven o'clock .
and in the afternoon it will be four p.m .
alright , my kids will % uh definitely love to see those animals .
yes , so this is the % uh show which is interesting , alright ?
but our show is not like the circus kind of show .
it just % uh shows you , yah , what the animals % uh do , alright , % uh in the wild as well % uh what they do .
alright .
yah .
alright , and by the way % uh by taking the mrt train ,
% uh how much is the % uh usual fare that they % uh-
that i need % uh to purchase ?
you will buy your ticket from the mrt train station .
we would have a ticket , a few ticket machines .
and % uh you will , they will tell you where-
which location you are now at and you just tell them-
you just press the button which destination you are going to stop ,
and the machine will tell you how much to % uh-
% uh how much is the fare .
% uh you just have to use singapore money to purchase your ticket .
so how much usu~
the machine will als~
yes , so it all depends on % uh where you 're taking from and where you are going to stop .
% uh the price range will range from a dollar forty cents % uh right up to two dollars and twenty cents .
per person .
okay .
dollar and twenty cents .
so going back to the rendezvous hotel again ,
% uh is there any more interesting place % uh beyond the vicinity of that hotel ?
yes .
okay , beyond the vicinity of the hotel of course there are shopping areas on orchard road
% uh and then you walk to the merlion park or you take the mrt .
% uh otherwise you can % uh walk to the museum , we have the national museum out there ,
the % uh singapore arts museum .
or do you want to consider doing ethnic places in singapore ?
% hm , yes % uh maybe i can consider going to an ethnic place .
% uh which ethnic place do you want me to recommend ?
yes .
% uh which ethnic place would you want me to recommend ?
anything .
is it-
yah , anything just beyond , you know , the vicinity of the hotel .
okay , % uh would i be able to introduce % uh you % uh to the indian quarters ?
indian quarters ?
a traditional indian place where the indians when they came to singapore ,
most of them live in this area .
so we have preserved this area and we call it little india .
% oh okay , it 's like a chinatown where the-
do chinese lives and this place is the indian place ?
yes .
so we have another area called chinatown .
and % uh this other place would be called little india .
and there is another malay area call kampong glam .
kampong glam .
malay you means like % uh the malaysians ?
yah .
% uh well the malays in singapore of course % uh the-
some of them were native in singapore .
% uh but our-
some of the malay ancestors came from the nearby % uh countries of malaysia ,
as well as indonesia .
so we would call % eh and of course % uh , yah , the nearby islands .
generally we call this area the malay archipelo .
malay archipelo , okay .
yes , so % uh but of course the people here , who are malay ,
and if they are locals here , they would have been born here .
% uh most of the people here would be third generation % uh singaporeans .
their ancestors will probably come from the nearby countries for the malays .
alright .
so maybe on my second day at singapore % uh i would prefer to transfer to another hotel .
% uh maybe like the first one is on % uh the business district .
maybe you could % um provide me some information on the province like surroundings ?
like in the city any more .
% uh , sorry , i do n't understand you .
maybe you could provide additional information like
% uh if i will travel or transfer to another hotel ,
% uh maybe you could provide some suggestion .
not on the commercial district , but on the somehow provincial ones .
provincial as in the residential area ?
yah , maybe at the residential area .
okay , there is % uh hotel called % uh the link hotel .
i-
l i n k .
and it is located in % uh a residential area , a very old residential area % uh call tiong bahru .
it is also a very accessible location , because there is the mrt
% uh that is located % um just about less than ten minutes ' walk to the mrt .
so the m-
so the mrt passes by this area also ?
yes , about ten minutes ' walk from this hotel .
so or if you look at the % uh photograph ?
the first photograph of the front facade of the hotel ,
% uh this was originally residential area .
% uh it 's a building that is originally residential but they have now been converted to a hotel .
okay , and do you recommend % uh ano-
% uh an attraction % uh nearby this hotel ?
and what are the rates on this hotel ?
okay , the attractions near to this hotel like i mention
% uh this is in a residential area .
so you would be % um going to a market , alright ,
that opens in the morning from % uh seven thirty to twelve o'clock .
so this market is what we call a wet market .
% uh they will sell fish , meat , fruits , vegetable in this market sold .
and you will be meeting a lot of local people % uh when you visit the market .
so it 's something i would say interesting
% uh because these are not the normal % uh tourist site .
so you get-
when you stay in this hotel , you get to interact with a lot of the local
because majority of the people that you meet % uh around your hotel area would be local .
yah , i think-
okay , so this is not % uh your popular tourist destination in singapore ?
% uh i would n't say it 's not the normal tourist belt , you know .
because you are % uh located in an area % uh that is very much residential .
but this a nice % uh boutique hotel .
alright , what are the rates in this hotel ?
okay , % uh the rates % uh of course again it depending sometimes they do have promotions
% uh in % uh certain % uh during certain dates .
alright , but it should be in the range of about two hundred % uh dollars .
per day ?
two hundred to-
% uh yes , per day .
per day meaning % uh from let say today it 's starts at two o'clock or three o'clock
to the next day % uh check out eleven or twelve o'clock the next day .
% hm , so i 'd like to get one of the promotions .
yes , so % uh again we have to see whether let say if you 're going to arrive
because i 'm planning to go there by april .
april .
okay , let 's see whether there 's any promotion in april .
% uh which date are we talking about ?
maybe april ten .
april the ten .
april ten to eleven .
okay , right .
we were going to have two adults and one kid .
okay .
alright , let see .
is there any promotions for this particular period ?
okay , this rate is not available here .
% oh this one % uh the link hotel daily set meal promo ,
from march one to % uh may thirty first .
yes .
would you be able to make it for this date ?
yah , % uh i can catch up on the date .
and if you could % uh provide the links of that certain hotel .
so maybe we can book in advance .
% uh it 's just called % uh link l i n k .
link .
hotel singapore .
alright .
so they % uh allow online booking for this hotel ?
yes , they have % uh online booking for this hotel yes .
so like the promotion , % oh yes they have-
% oh no that is the set meal promo for that period of time in may .
% uh , yah for the month of may .
alright .
okay , and % uh we have something quite interesting out there .
% uh over the weekend a lot of people % uh would be bringing out their birds .
the owners-
come again ?
birds .
just at the corner of the link hotel , you have this like % uh a birds corner .
the owners of the birds , they 'll be bringing out their birds in their cages and they
yah , so and they will-
% oh birds , % ah okay .
yah , the birds yes .
so % uh the owners will just have a chit chatting session with their friends .
and the birds gets to meet their friends as well .
so it 's something a little bit unusual .
% uh again you do n't see in the mainstream kind of % uh tourist area ,
but you get to see this in our housing state .
yes .
or residential area .
and that is somehow % uh different .
okay .
yes , it 's a different experience for % uh the bird corners .
and % uh also % uh the market , you know , pay a visit to our market .
again it 's a different experience altogether .
and for food wise , % uh just above the market , there is % uh open-air-
not open-air , it 's a non-air-condition food court .
so you can have your breakfast over there , you can have lunch or you can have dinner .
yes .
alright .
that sound very nice .
so any other thing % uh that you like to do or your son would like to do ?
% uh not at this time .
% uh maybe on the april time when we go there % uh we can % uh go directly on your recommended place .
and we 're considering going back around december this year also .
so maybe would-
we can stay on a different place .
yes , if you are coming in december , again it 's something different .
% uh then i would recommend that you stay right in the heart of orchard road .
% uh because in december , we light up the whole street of orchard road to the marina % uh area .
so the street looks % uh like a wonderland .
% uh and the buildings , the hotels , will be also specially decorated for christmas .
so it 's wonderful time to visit in december .
the orchard road , so any recommendations there if we might consider going back ?
okay , you can stay at the elizabeth hotel .
that is just ten minutes ' walk up to the orchard road area .
okay , elizabeth hotel .
elizabeth hotel , so can you please show us , show me .
yah .
again it 's not like % uh that big a hotel .
and it's-
so the rates , yes .
so the rates here are % um still % uh affordable ?
yes the rates are still affordable .
okay , i 'm showing you elizabeth hotel now .
okay , it still in the price range of about two hundred .
but it is a nice % uh small hotel % uh not that big hotel and it just walk ten minutes or less ,
% uh to the main % uh orchard road shopping area .
okay , so this is the elizabeth hotel and
do you want me to show you % uh the christmas time , how does the street look like ?
yes , i would like to see that .
okay , i 'm gon na show you % uh the christmas light-up % uh in % uh last year .
okay , this is how % uh the street % uh looks like .
by the way is the orchard road accessible from the first hotel that you 've mention
the rendezvous hotel ?
if like we could travel from the rendezvous to the orchard place ?
yes , you can , it 's just % uh a walk of about ten minutes and you are in % uh orchard road .
alright , it doesn't-
that is so near .
yes .
so it 's also % uh interesting place % uh to stay and you can see
this is the last year , the christmas light-up in orchard road .
it looks like a christmas wonderland , is n't it ?
yah .
so the whole place lights up with christmas lights ?
yes , and every year the theme will change .
so % uh this year two zero one two would be different from last year .
alright .
so last year would be % uh all the % uh winter kind of % uh feeling .
% uh this year will be different theme and it's-
the light up stretches from the beginning of orchard road right up to the marina area .
% uh it 's a pretty long stretch of road that is lighted up .
so the whole commercial district is kinda connected to one another ?
yes , just one straight road down .
% uh orchard road is a pretty straight road all the way down to the marina square .
so the rendezvous hotel is on that vicinity also , so we can walk around the area and
get to-
get a chance to % uh come by along the orchard road .
yes .
yes , correct .
you are somewhere between-
rendezvous is somewhere between orchard and the marina square area .
alright , but we can not see christmas lights on april .
% uh yes , no christmas lights in april .
only in december .
all-
right .
% uh i think that 's all .
% uh thank you for % um the suggestions .
and i 'm glad that now , you could show me around singapore and % uh -
are you sure you % um have % uh most of the information that you need ?
% oh basically that 's all i need .
% uh i need hotel % uh suite rates , restaurants , % uh nearby attractions , interesting places .
% uh one last thing though % uh except-
% uh aside from those things % uh , what can you recommend more % uh if i 'd like to
you know , go back to singapore on a yearly basis ?
yearly basis ?
yah .
then i would recommend that you spend % uh more time % uh exploring the area .
and of course we have a lot more other interesting museums
for example war museums in singapore , we have % uh nice parks % uh wetland parks ,
if you like something and you get wet .
specially for your kids , we have wildwest , % uh wet and wild
% uh in the eastern part of singapore .
and we have recently also open-up in the eastern part of singapore northeast ,
% um a very interesting park % uh at the % uh pasir ris % uh area .
so these are parks which % uh again a lot more locals would be visiting .
% uh they are usually located right next to the % uh river area .
so this % uh establishments are just newly opened ?
% uh not all are newly open , some are the older ones .
% uh but our latest one would be the one at pasir ris .
par series ?
yes , it is % um on the east-
northeast of singapore .
northeast side .
if you mind can you % uh please show me that one ?
sure .
pasir ris , alright .
yah .
so it 's a park actually ?
yes , it 's a park % uh nice to stroll around in the evening , % uh morning .
% uh we have like % uh % uh mangrove area .
so it 's more like a wetland place ?
% uh not just wetland , % uh you can see this is the town park ?
okay .
so there 's a swimming complex in there .
% uh this is not meant for swimming , it 's just a park .
but it 's just a good scenery .
see , this is very nice to walk around , there are broad walk for you to walk .
lots of greenery .
okay , so this is % uh-
and we have interesting parks all over the % uh-
all over singapore , alright ?
so you could see % uh a lot of the areas , the residential areas , we have one of this park so ,
% uh you get to see greenery , not just % uh buildings and not just shops in singapore .
alright .
so this map is the whole of singapore ?
yah , this is a map of singapore , okay , and we have like if you look at the % uh parameter ,
% uh most of this we have some parks out there .
you could see % uh the shaded area on the % uh right-hand corner ?
that 's pasir ris park .

does he like animals ?
okay .
yes , he likes animals and % uh he loves to play outside % um .
okay .
i would like to recommend % um the zoo for him .

% uh no major preparation before vesak day .
yup .
% uh the next % uh major festival would be hari raya in august .
and deepavali in the month of november .
okay .
yes , i see .
alright .
so this will be more % um-
i would say the major festival where you will see a lot more preparation
% um and a very carnival festive mood % uh just before this public holidays .
okay .
and also can i add % um i-
if i 'm a nature lover % um if there 's any % uh tourist spots that you will recommend to me ?
% uh nature as in plants or in birds or fishes ?
% um i think % um-
or coral-
i mean % uh marine life ?
% um % uh plants or % uh looks like % um a park or
anythings that i can see some natures .
see some nature .
okay .
well i would like to recommend you this % uh hill which is at-
a very popular hill in singapore , for the local as well .
alright .
we call it the bukit timah nature reserve .
okay .
this is our tallest hill in singapore .
okay .
okay , you can see some pictures now ?
% uh and in fact our bukit timah nature reserve has one of the % um-
a lot of % uh flora and fauna as you climb up the hill .
yup .
but as-
if you are too tired , you can always turn around
and there will be some small animals that you will see along the way .
okay .
is there any % um-
okay , so this is the bukit timah .
okay .
% um can i ask is there any % um % uh entrance fee or a fee that we-
i have to pay before entering that % uh reserve-
nature reserve ?
okay .
there 's no entrance fee % um and it would be better if you either go in the morning or the evening .
% hm okay .
is there any % uh particular rules that should i % um follow when-
% uh well of course % uh dress comfortably , good walking shoes .
% uh bring water with you and also hat with you .
okay .
okay .
and of course do not wander off the normal trail .
that means if there 's no trail , do not walk on those trail .
so just do the normal walkway and there are also walking trail , there will be signs that this is a walking trail .
do not wander off the normal walking trail and you will be fine .
okay .
okay .
is there % eh oh .
it is % uh quite a popular hill .
so there will be-
usually % uh some people that you will meet along the way .
it 's just not like so quiet that you do n't see anybody at all .
okay .
% um is there % uh there is an % uh restaurant or a-
some food chain % uh even % uh
for example we do n't want to carry some loads to bring us there .
is there any restaurant % uh when we % uh
so we can eat there .
okay , for the bukit nature reserve park % uh we do n't have any % uh restaurants out there
but just across the road % uh there are quite a few eating places .
so when you alight % uh when you climb down from the tree-
% uh from the hill , just go across the road and there will be quite a lot of eating places out there .
% uh restaurants as well as non-air conditioned % uh we call it coffee shops .
% uh okay .
% um % uh anything else-
so maybe-
yes , so maybe at the same time if you 're going to climb % uh bukit timah
you can also bring along some snacks with you .
% uh just also % uh be careful , do n't put your food items in plastic bag .
put them inside your bag because % uh there will be some monkeys on the hill .
okay .
and they will think that , you know , your plastic bag would have contained food
and they may % um disturb you .
okay , thank you .
and how about % uh anything else that % um where we can go % uh for visit ?
okay , i mentioned earlier on % uh i would like to recommend the zoo -
% uh for your % uh child
because % uh our zoo is very nice .
and it-
% uh the animals are not keep-
are not kept in % uh cages .
oh .
so it 's an open zoo .
he will get to see or you will get to see elephants , orang-utans .
% uh in fact singapore zoo has the largest collection of orang-utan .
okay .
so i 'm showing you the-
% uh okay , i will show you the % uh attractions-
% uh that can be found in the zoo .
okay .
i think this will interest him , the polar bear .
okay .
% um i have a-
just limited time to visit % uh singapore .
it 's about for one or to two days .
% uh for one day , i can travel around to-
around singapore ?
i mean for % uh do-
% uh yes .
can i % um-
i will visit every % eh tourist spots in singapore within a day ?
% uh well i would say that you have to be selective .
% uh we have so many things to see in singapore
so if it 's just a one day programme-
then you can do a three hours tour of the zoo .
or you can do at morning , the bukit timah hill
and have a lunch in % uh one of our local non-air conditioned to the zoo .
alright .
% uh huh .
and in lunch time , you can actually do a relaxing river cruise on the singapore river .
okay .
okay , so i will just show you % uh the river cruise .
% uh just a short ride on the singapore river .
% uh yes .
so that will be something quite relaxing .
and after your river cruise , you could have a dinner .
yes , you can see the boat now ?
on this kind of river cruise , it 's about a half an hour cruise .
and you could alight at the-
this is the % uh the clarke quay area or boat quay area and have a nice dinner .
okay .
for how much % uh for a ride in the cruise ?
the cruise will cost you fifteen dollars for an adult .
and for your child , it will be eight dollars singapore money .
okay .
okay .
% uh for the cruise , it includes the food ?
% uh no .
on the cruise itself , there 's no food provided .
it 's just a cruise on the singapore river .
so it 's just half an hour ride .
and there will be a commentary % uh on the cruise itself to tell you
what you are looking at on the left and right-hand side of the % uh places that you 're going to pass by .
alright .
the cruise-
yes , this is the cruise that i 'm talking about .
okay .
it 's a chinese looking kind of a boat .
% uh huh .
and % uh can you give some % uh examples that you 're talking about .
the places where i can see like in-
during that cruise .
which one will be the highlight of the cruise ?
okay .
the cruise like i mentioned is only a half an hour ride .
yup .
% uh you will pass by some of the highlight , the financial district area .
% uh so you see a lot of skyscrapers .
and % uh you will see % uh bridges .
alright , old bridges in singapore .
and you will also get to see % uh-
you will also get to see % uh the old warehouses .
% uh okay .
% um and of course the icon of singapore , the merlion .
yes , okay .
okay .
so on-
this is what you are going to see % uh on the cruise .
so it 's just a short cruise .
if you look on the right-hand side % uh can you see the blue shaded area ?
okay , this is actually the singapore river .
okay , so you will be travelling out this way , out to the marina bay .
okay .
now i 'm gon na just show you this picture here .
okay , now , you can see ?
yes .
alright .
so this is the boat that 's going to % uh travel on the singapore river , you 're going to see % uh this scene .
okay .
% uh now , the houses that 's yellow in colour % uh that is actually clarke quay .
so i 'm saying that when the boat gets stopped back , you can go for a dinner , a nice dinner .
whether you choose to have a fine dining or casual place cafe
there are all % uh kind of food there including spanish , mexican , indian chinese , seafood , barbecue .
they 're all found there .
so you can walk around and choose a restaurant that you like .
okay .
yes .
alright .
so this is what you 're going to see % uh on the cruise itself .
and % uh of course they-
when you come out of the bay , you will see the merlion % uh icon .
yes .
okay .
% uh for-
in terms of communication , what are-
what would be the preferred language if there , you know .
oh .
our language of administration here is english so our street sign % uh will be english .
all our documents will be english .
the menu % um given to you by the restaurants will also be written in english .
all service staff will be speaking english .
okay , that 's nice .
% um anything else in si-
in the package % uh so where we can-
where can i go ?
% uh for one day ?
okay this is the programme that i would say % uh it has something for your son to do .
yah .
as well as % uh a little bit of relaxing cruise in the night time .
but of course there are lots of other things that you can do in singapore .
for example , we have universal studio in sentosa .
% uh you could also do that instead of doing the zoo .
% um in the afternoon , you could go over to sentosa and do universal studio in the afternoon .
% uh huh .
% uh what we-
% uh what i'm-
what will be the highlights there in universal studio ?
okay .
the highlight , i think % uh that will be different .
there are other % uh stu-
% uh universal studios do not have would be the latest ride , it 's called transformer .
okay .
okay .
so this is quite an exciting ride % uh for you and your son .
yah , this is the ride that i 'm talking about .
so there are seven zones % uh to explore in universal % uh studio .
you can see there 's hollywood , new york , sci-fi , ancient egypt and lost world and far far away and madagascar .
alright .
so these are the seven zone % uh that you can visit in universal studio .
oh yes .
okay .
okay .
you can see all these are the scene % uh street scene of universal studio .
so there are lots of rides there as well .
% uh okay .
is there any particular % uh museums where we can go in singapore ?
% uh for both your son and yourself or more for your son ?
yah .
for % hm-
yes .
more for your son ?
yup .
% uh alright .
i would % uh recommend to you % uh to bring him to the science centre in singapore .
it 's % um-
it will be suitable for a young % uh person .
is there an entran-
okay , and-
yes ?
% uh on-
is there an entrance fee ?
yes , the admission charges % uh for the science centre % uh would be-
nine dollars for an adult and five dollars for the children-
for the child .
okay .
and it is located in the western part of singapore .
okay .
do you need me to give you direction how to get there ?
yes please .
okay .
now % um i will always come back to city hall mrt -
because this is one of our interchange .
and % uh it 's the interchange between the east and the west line .
% uh so because we have not chosen the hotel yet , so i will just-
for reference , go back to city hall .
from city hall , you take the west line and you alight at jurong east mrt train station .
from there when you come out , you will just walk about ten minutes
and you get to the singapore science centre .
oh .
well , okay , thank you .
% um do you have any % uh beaches in
there in singapore .
% uh what do you say ?
% um beach .
oh beach .
yes , we do have beach on the mainland .
% uh but it is-
it will be just a simple beach .
yup .
oh .
and % uh-
yes .
can you-
can you please % uh show me ?
okay , i will show you the % uh beaches in singapore .
yup .
% uh this is in the east coast so it 's just a simple beach .
alright .
% uh it 's a little bit rocky over in the % uh east coast and also the changi beach % uh of singapore .
is it open for the public ?
do you want to go there for swimming or-
is it for swimming ?
yes .
oh for swimming , okay .
i like swimming , yup .
% uh well , the changi beach and the east coast beach % um will not be fine sand .
alright , it 's a little bit rocky .
okay .
the sand is a little bit % um coarse .
but % uh on saturdays afternoon and sundays afternoon , the-
you will see more local people going there for swimming .
otherwise we have % uh better beaches over on sentosa island .
like % uh palawan as well as % uh siloso beach over on the sentosa island .
okay , thank you .
% uh anything else you can add with aside from some-
those tourist spots that you have given to me ?
% uh okay , if you intend to extend your holidays in singapore , of course like i said
there 's a lot more things to do .
% uh now , i 'm actually showing you a map of sentosa .
but for one day % uh you really have to be very selective so we do have other museums in singapore or
like the national museum which highlights the % uh history of singapore .
% uh arts museum % uh where you see contemporary art .
% um war museum .
okay , if your son is interested % uh to know a little bit about the war
because singapore was occupied by the japanese .
% uh we do have quite a few war museums as well .
% um so for visits to museum , well , depending on how big the museum is .
okay .
minimum one to three hours , alright , would be sufficient .
okay .
% uh for a tourist % uh what would be the maximum days that will give-
the immigration will give for a tourist .
okay .
% uh normally for immigration , we give a one month % uh visitor pass .
% hm okay .
so you seems to be concerned about some rules and regulation with singapore .
yes .
can you please % uh tell me something about it ?
% uh okay .
like i said % uh we do not encourage littering .
% um % uh so if you does any litter , please throw them into the % uh litter bins , the rubbish bin .
% uh for lighting of % uh cigarette , there are quite a few restriction now including the airport .
so % um in short , very simple , anything that 's indoor , in the restaurants , yes , we do not allow % uh cigarettes to be lighted up .
% uh including bus stop .
so there must be % uh-
like an area % uh from the-
enclosed area that you can do % uh light up of cigarettes .
% uh yes .
so i think these are the major concern otherwise % uh crime rate here is pretty low .
% uh you are able to move around quite freely even in the night time .
as usual just avoid all the dark lanes % um and do not carry too much cash with you .
% uh that then you will be having a very enjoyable time in singapore .
% hm okay , so % uh .
okay , thank you for that informations .
% um % uh about % uh % um i 've heard that % uh you have a night safari .
can you please % uh tell me something about it ?
okay , the night safari opens in the night time .
from seven thirty to eight o'clock .
again it is an open night safari , you wo n't see cages in this night safari .
it is just next door to the zoo .
okay , so if your son is really into animals , you could do the afternoon zoo .
at night , you could bring him over just next door to the night safari .
now if you look at the first picture .
% uh this is a tram that brings you around the night safari .
so that you are not too tired .
you don ' have to walk the entire park .
and on this two tram ride itself , of course you see about seventy per cent of the animals .
% uh huh .
it will be different from what you see in the zoo .
so you see the leopards here , the malayan tapir , the fishing cat .
okay .
% uh huh .
and if you are not too tired , you can do a walk-
short walk in the middle of the tram ride , there is-
the tram will stop , you can do a walking trail towards the leopard area .
% uh that will take you about forty minutes .
half an hour to forty minutes and you go back to the tram station and board back the next tram .
that will bring you back to the entrance area
and you can do another walking trail called the fishing cat trail .
oh % hm .
alright .
so-
and if you are not too tired again , there is a forest giant trail .
again , from the entrance area that you can walk .
alright , fishing cat trail , about twenty minutes .
and if you want to see some shows , we do have two shows in the night safari .
% uh but usually there 's a long queue to see the creatures of the night show .
okay .
okay .
okay .
this is a show . it 's a-
this is a show . it 's a-
just a twenty minute show-
thirty minute show .
and they will bring in some animals % uh the smaller animals % uh for the audience to look at .
% hm and how about the admission fee , how much is that ?
how much is that ?
okay , the admission fee for the night safari will be thirty two dollars for the adult .
and the child will be twenty one dollars .
okay .
i think it 's nice .
% um that one is good for my child .
% um i also heard that there is a % um ocean park % uh-
do i % um-
do you have an ocean park there in singapore ?
yes , we call our % uh ocean park , the underwater world .
alright .
yes .
alright .
and this is located in % um sentosa island .
okay .
can you please % uh show me some datas ab-
show our datas-
some datas about that % um underworld .
okay , the underworld is located on sentosa island .
so i 'm now flashing you some of the photographs taken in the underwater world .
now over here % uh the highlight would be-
you go into the basement area .
you step on the travelator and you were actually in an underground % uh tank , a very big tank .
so inside the travelator , you will get to see sharks , alright .
stingray and lots of other kinds of fishes .
% uh in this underwater world , you do n't have to walk .
alright , the travelator will bring you around .
% uh you can really get to see a lot of % uh marine life when you 're in this % uh travelator .
now besides this travelator , if you look at the bottom right-hand corner .
% hm okay .
% uh huh .
oh .
these are what we call mimicry .
you see this % uh yellow colour looking marine life ?
yup .
okay .
now it 's on the screen now .
now if this marine-
cry-
% uh marine % uh sea creature , it 's among the seaweeds .
you can really miss this marine % uh sea creature .
okay .
alright , they actually looks like a seaweed or a plant .
yes .
it 's looks like a seahorse weed .
yes .
but actually if it 's among the plant , you ca n't even miss this % um % uh sea creature .
okay , so these are just some of the sea marine life that you would see in the underwater world .
but this is on sentosa island .
so if you 're going to choose sentosa , then you can do the beach , the underwater world and the universal studio
all in one day
because they 're in the same location .
oh i see .
i think i have % uh last more concern about .
for example % uh i have % uh given for one or to two days .
% uh i have-
i want to extend % uh my stay in singapore .
% uh what should i do % uh to extend ?
% uh do i need to go to immigration or-
to extend the date ?
% uh no .
because when you come in to singapore , our immigration officers % uh would normally give you
a one month stay in singapore .
so there 's no need to extend it % uh your stay in singapore .
okay .
% uh huh .
but do check on your passport , you know , what is the validity that 's given to you .
but i would say normally one month .
% uh okay .
% uh if i exceeded one month , what-
okay , if you forgot , alright % uh to see what is your length of stay in singapore
and you overstayed in singapore , then please bring your passport and yourself
to our immigration office in lavender % uh street .
alright , we have an immigration % uh office there .
and tell them % uh your situation .
oh okay .
i think i have % uh all the information that i needed .
% um anything else you want to add % um-
alright .
for-
if you intend to visit the universal studio , i will recommend that you book your tickets online first
just in case , you know , that day happens to be a very crowded day
because we do have a limit % uh as in % uh visitors % uh going into the universal studio .
okay .
% uh how much for the admission fee ?
% uh to the universal studio , for the adult on a weekday , it will be sixty eight dollars .
% uh weekends , public holidays , will be seventy four dollars .
for the child , it will be fifty dollars .
and weekend will be % uh fifty four % uh dollars .
% uh also for % uh certain rides in the universal studio , there 's a height limit .
% uh for certain rides like roller coaster , the child would be have-
% uh to be approximately about % uh one point two % uh metres tall .
okay , for certain rides in the park .
oh okay .
okay , thank you very much for that % uh-
for helping me .
% um that 's all .
so i hope you will-
you know % uh visit us soon .
yes , i will .
thank you so much .
alright .
welcome .
bye .
bye .

for two days
in singapore .

% uh , did you say that it 's for three people ?
that 's right .
% uh can i just have your profile what is your age group ?
are you in your twenties ?
thirties or-
i-
yes % uh i have-
two of us is on twenties and one is el~
i believe it 's thirteen years old .
one child then more or less ?
yes , that 's right .
% ah okay .
% um , what are your % uh dates of travel ?
do you-
have you planned or is it open ?
well i 'm planning by next week .
i believe for-
it 's twe~
march twenty nine to thirtieth .
% oh twenty-ninth to thirtieth , % uh-
% um % hm , that 's right .
so that 's only one night you can actually stay two nights , right ?
yes .
% uh mar~
are there thirty one days in march ?
you could stay till april the first .
so-
well , i 'm planning to because i have a budget only for-
i believe for one thousand singaporean dollars .
so do you think that for-
up to april first , is it okay ?
% uh , okay let 's see .
are you willing to stay % uh at a budget hotel ?
because you have a thirteen-year-old ?
% um % hm , yes .
it 's okay .
if you 're willing to stay at % uh dormitories ,
your thousand dollars will be able to accommodate all three of you .
okay , that 's great .
that means you only pay about
twenty to % uh maybe thirty , forty dollars a room night .
a room ni~
but you % uh the toilets would be outside , you know what i mean ?
you are sh~
having shared toilets .
well a~
% uh huh .
i see .
well is there any hotels that
accommodates with a separate commodes inside the room ?
% uh , so what you want is actually small rooms ?
% hm with a comfort room inside .
with a toilet attached , huh ?
yes .
okay .
you know , it's~
we~
kinda like private , you know .
alright .
but the rooms will not be large .
well , it-
is it okay can it be fit for three people ?
because we want to share only for one room .
wait .
let me see , huh ?
that 's okay .
because i am with my girlfriend and also his brother with me .
so , it 's kinda difficult to separate our ,
you know , one child .
% uh you have a chaperone , huh ?
for your girlfriend .
that 's right .
that 's right .
let me just check for you .
okay .
well , is it okay to-
if i may ask you in the hotels
and because i want to confess for her .
i want to propose to her a marriage .
so , do you know any places that ,
you know , that kinda romantic and at the same time unique place
to propose a girl~
to a girl ?
% uh , yes .
do you like gardens ?
% hm sure .
that 's kinda good .
so do you know any places with gardens , you know ?
there is a place i know .
it 's called hortpark .
h o r t short for horticultural .
and it is a~
it is~
% uh that is in there a little % uh structure
that 's made of trees that have been formed to look like a little~
very small building .
and % uh hortpark in fact allows you to use the rooms
for a formal wedding proposal .
wow .
but you can use that little garden area
without paying for the room if you are not using the room
because you are not inviting all your friends , right ?
yes , that 's right .
we 're only three people there .
so , i think there will be no charge for that .
you just % uh go there .
you may just have to bear with maybe visitors looking at you .
well it 's not a problem
as long as i can confess to her .
% oh that would be very romantic . % um-
ye~
and the only thing is you have to % uh-
yes ?
you have to maybe bring a big umbrella in case it rains .
% uh when it is ,
you know , % uh when you have finished proposing and it starts to rain .
well i 'll keep that in mind .
thank you so much for that .
you just tell her that in singapore
we consider rain to be good fortune .
% oh that 's good .
because we all need rain , do n't we ?
yes that 's right .
and also i would just like to know
how do i get there ?
that location .
do i have to ,
you know , in~
how transportation , all kind of stuff
that which mean accessible at the same time fastest way to go there ?
you can take a bus .
and % uh you can reach the outside of the park
there are clear signs .
and then you walk in and it 's very romantic
because as you walk in , it 's % uh
the pathway just outside is called the floral walk .
so you have flowers and plants
you can take a lot of photos on your way in .
wow .
well that 's right .
a o~
maybe i should bring my camera there so that i can-
and-
the-
% uh yes .
that 's a good idea . % uh-
okay .
so in our hotel that i 've asked you
well how much will i pay for that for until april one ?
until april one ?
i 'm trying to get a fairly nice hotel .
but in chinatown we do have boutique hotels
that would cost you a bit more .
well how much is that ?
okay % um-
i 'm just trying to find you a room
that can put in an extra bed
for your girlfriend 's brother .
% oh yah .
well thanks so much for that .
i really need it .
% uh the hotels -
yah .
the hotels in chinatown tend to be rather % uh small
because they are converted from-
restored shophouses .
% oh i see .
well that 's okay .
as long as we are comfortable to sleep in
well that 's totally fine for me .
okay .
there is a very good hotel
which is actually four or five-star .
and the price to me
it is quite reasonable .
% uh , it 's in fact a boutique hotel .
it 's called hotel nineteen twenty nine .
it is run by a young man
who loves taking old buildings and converting them .
and-
in this one % um they have a rooftop garden
where you can also propose to her if you like .
well that 's very nice place .
so how much is for one one night stay there ?
so because march twenty nine to april one , right ?
so how much will it cost me ?
% uh the-
on the website ,
it 's just a little over two hundred dollars .
so in all in all stay that will be the cost or ?
yes .
% uh they have a suite room .
% uh and it has a long bath-
% uh on the balcony .
but i have seen it the bal-
the-
where the long bath is .
it is shielded by plants .
and they claimed they have done research
where the tall buildings , you know ,
they overlook but they ca n't really see you bathing .
% uh so it 's very unique .
% uh so you may call it a budget hotel
but it 's also known as a boutique hotel .
so maybe that is the most romantic place for you .
i see .
let me book for that .
well i'm-
i must see that location you told me the long bath with the ,
you know , in the outside with the mirror on it .
i-
yes .
well it 's kinda unique .
yes .
% uh , do you see it on your screen ?
% oh yes .
i saw it right now .
okay .
i also have another titbit for you .
keong saik road in my father 's and grandfather 's time
was a red-light district .
but it is all cleaned up now
and that 's why we have hotels there .
% oh that 's why .
so on the first day what-
that we 'll land in singapore we want to go there .
how do i go to the hotel nineteen twenty nine ?
okay .
% um let me get you the mass rapid transit map .
okay .
that 's good .
so i just want to ask in the hotel ,
are they selling some souvenirs ?
souvenirs will be all around .
it would be-
% uh you would be in chinatown .
so it 's very easy for you .
i am getting you the map now .
sure please do .
i would like to see how to go there
so that to avoid delays in our trip .
and so since you have quite a nice hotel
% uh i suggest you come in by train .
and use the trains and the buses to move around
because many of our buses like
ninety nine point nine nine are-
per cent are air-conditioned .
almost all are air-conditioned now .
% uh unless the air conditioner % uh breaks down .
% uh and some of them are double-decker buses
so you 're on % uh upper deck you can have a very good view .
well , i want to check on that
the bus that you told me earlier .
okay .
can you see the map now ?
yes .
i can see it now .
okay .
can you see on the right-hand side sort of in the middle
can you see changi airport at number three ?
yes .
okay .
that 's where you would start taking your train ride .
so what you do is when you arrived ,
change your money at the airport .
okay .
and go down to the basement .
there are signs leading you % uh to the mrt .
it 's mass rapid transit .
that 's the name of our rail system .
so there you approach the officer
and buy a ez-link ticket .
ez-link ticket ?
wha~
yes .
that will allow you to use the buses and trains
and you also get a discount . % uh ins~
and you also get a discount . % uh ins~
and if you use cash ,
it 's a bit more expensive .
% hm i see .
because % uh after you stored value when you return ,
they charge you a small fee for the manufacture of the card
but you get your refund back of the unused portion .
wow .
that 's good .
so probably i will just buy the ez-link one .
yes .
that 's right .
you buy for all three of you .
yes .
you will have to buy adult tickets
because the thirteen-year-old is not a student in singapore .
he 's not a young child .
he is not ,
you know , if he 's six or seven , you can get a child ticket
but he has to get adult ticket .
so you take your green line and you follow it down to city hall .
city hall ?
yes .
city hall is % uh one of the interchange stations
and you-
if you like % uh on another day ,
you can get off there and have a look around there .
but otherwise , you continue down to-
no , let me see .
yes .
you get off at city hall and you switch to the red line to dhoby ghaut .
can you see dhoby ghaut at number eight ?
yes .
so is this a train station also ?
yes .
% uh dhoby ghaut is where three lines meet .
can you see ?
% uh % huh . yes i saw-
i see it .
so it 's also-
yah .
it 's also a very big shopping centre % uh with restaurants , cafes .
a little garden nearby as well .
so at dhoby ghaut you will just take two stops
down to chinatown .
% uh okay .
i see .
okay .
i get it now .
so how many hours should i-
it will take to go to chinatown ?
approximi~
or you know , just as estimation ?
e~
it 's very fast on the trains .
% uh maybe forty minutes considering you come in at non peak hours
where you wait two minutes more for the train .
% uh that 's okay .
it 's a very reasonable time .
% uh that 's fine with me
as long as we can go to chinatown and ,
you know , take some rest .
and you are not staying too many days
so you just carry a backpack or , you know , small luggage you can-
yes .
as you walk to your hotel ,
you can look around at the shops in chinatown
places you might want to come back to eat , to shop .
so i just want to ask , in chinatown ,
what is the most popular restaurant there which is affordable ?
% uh affordable but you want to bring your girlfriend there , right ?
yah , that 's right .
% uh just , you know ,
want to sightseeing and also want to eat something different .
do you mind chinese food ?
that 's okay .
this is a very special chinese food .
% uh it 's right in the heart of chinatown
and the restaurant is called lee kui % uh ( ah hoi ) .
lee kui .
% uh it 's in a street called mosque street .
mosque street ? % um % hm .
i 'm trying to see if they have it on the website
otherwise i can tell you
i have a brochure here which
makes me want to go there to eat tonight .
% oh lee kui ( ah hoi ) .
okay .
so what is their specialty in ter~
in regards to the chinese food ?
% uh okay .
they ha~
this is a dialect cuisine called teochew .
and we have % uh crab .
% uh we also have % uh it's-
the crab is cold crab .
are you familiar with cold crab ?
huh ?
actually no .
what kind of that-
what kind of dish is that ?
% uh it-
i-
% uh it 's a special dialect kind of food .
the cold crab is tasty .
people are used to chili crab .
but if you do n't like chili ,
this is a little bit % uh closer to not hurting your taste buds .
% uh it has got gravy to go with it as well
% uh except that the cold crab is in fact raw .
but it is soaked in vinegar .
i do n't know if you like vinegar .
i love vinegar so i like this dish .
well the counterpart of that is this spicy crab .
so is it cooked or is it raw ?
well no .
that one is cooked .
and you have a lot of chili in it .
well i prefer it to be cooked .
that one it should be cooked . rather than ,
that one it should be cooked . rather than ,
you know , i do n't want to upset my stomach .
okay .
alright then .
% uh there is also something called jelly pork .
% uh the pork , you know ,
when you cook , you get these gravies that form a jelly ?
and it 's very tasty .
so it 's almost like you 're eating a dessert that is savoury in taste .
% oh that 's good .
it 's kinda unique .
well i must try that .
well is it affordable for-
you know , for % uh three people ?
three people % um maybe seventy dollars i would think .
it depends on how big is your appetite how much you order .
how-
okay .
i just must taken out of that in terms of budgeting .
% uh they have also something like
deep fried pork and liver roll .
and % uh yam paste .
% uh yam paste is quite a sweet dessert .
the yam is cooked % uh
that would be the ending of your meal .
so if you have eaten too much , you can skip the dessert .
aw .
well my girlfriend e~
loves sweet , you know , you have-
she has a sweet tongue so i must try that yam paste that you told me .
yes that-
so i 'll just put a note on that .
yah .
that would be quite nice .
i think it 's a little bit like a filipino type of dessert .
it 's % uh sweet and it 's sticky , you know .
% hm yes .
my girlfriend loves that so probably we will buy that also .
and also since we are in chinatown ,
do you know any places there-
a place there that we can bought souvenirs ,
you know , kinda like t-shirts ?
yes .
all over .
when you walk out of your hotel and you walk down the main road ,
you will find that there are lots of little
streets leading off the main road that is called north bridge road .
and they have stalls set up along the road
so you can check out the stalls .
well i rather to prepare myself to saw-
to see that .
ha~
% uh t-shirts are just a few dollars .
% uh they are not the high end sort .
and you can also buy souvenirs like ten dollars for three souvenirs .
alright .
and they would be all different kinds , different colours .
okay .
so i wa~
there 's a place also that i want to go in .
it 's in universal studio .
so do you know how to go there ?
universal studios , yes .
let me get you the mrt map again .
well-
okay .
well thank you for the restaurants and the hotel .
you help me a lot that-
in that time .
well-
all along the same street , there are other restaurants .
so you can just , you know , walk through and have a look .
and quite often in chinatown , they display their menu outside
so you can gauge what the actual prices of the food you are going to eat will cost .
what i 'm giving you is just an estimate .
okay .
well that 's okay .
i 'll just keep that in mind also ,
you know because this is my first time to book i~
to trip for , you know , overseas .
just kinda nervous about this
so i just want to check out my budget so that we can go , you know .
okay so where is the-
okay .
% uh let me show you .
% uh are you hearing me ?
yes .
okay .
let me show you first from your hotel in chinatown
to go to the place i recommended for you to do your proposal ,
if you do n't want to do it at the rooftop of your hotel , okay ? % uh-
yah .
yes sure .
please do .
so you take the % um line-
the blue line right down to harbourfront .
can you see that ?
yes .
and here is the start of the north east line .
so you switch , you go to the circle line which is the yellow line .
and you move along to just one stop in fact .
% uh one or two stops , it does n't make a difference .
either telok blangah or labrador , you get off % uh the bus -
% uh get off the train and you get on to a bus .
% uh when you reached the bus stop at the back ,
there will be signs to tell you the buses that stops there and the route it 's going .
% uh huh .
okay .
alexandra road .
yes and hortpark .
which is just one street down .
so the bus will make a turn and it will drop you almost in front-
in fact it is in front of this garden that i 'm telling you about .
% uh huh .
okay .
that 's nice .
well i 'm just asking that % uh in advance
because i want to go there with her by before april first since-
i believe in march thirty first we 're going there
so that i can propose to her .
yah .
yes .
very good .
% uh that will be a very nice romantic setting .
and it should n't be too crowded .
% uh it will give you a little bit of privacy .
you just need to bring maybe if you want to bring snacks or something
% uh you can have a little picnic .
if you walk into the garden , there are sheltered areas there .
and bring your camera , you can take lots of photos .
i see .
so we 're allowed to bring food inside the park ?
yes you are .
you just need to bring a plastic bag
to make sure you collect all your leftover % uh crackers or cups
and then you dispose them in the proper bins .
okay .
so thank you so much for that for giving me the direction
to go to the place i want to propose to my girlfriend .
so i want to know also before , you know , the proposal
we want to go to sentosa and also to universal studios singapore .
so can you please help me out how to go to universal 's first ?
okay .
you see the same blue line from chinatown ?
so this time you take it to harbourfront
but you walk to the bus terminals
% uh which is % uh just nearby .
and you will also pass a food centre ,
so you might want to check out some of the local foods there .
we have a lot of % uh muslim food
and we also have my favourite fish soup stall there
in the middle of the food centre .
but if you 're in a hurry then
you just go just behind the food centre a few steps away to the bus bay
right at the corner next to the mrt station
and you board a shuttle bus that goes into sentosa directly .
% uh huh .
okay .
% uh you can also cross the road and take the light rail
but i think this way it 's much easier .
so-
okay .
i 'll just keep on mind what you tell me earlier .
so probably i will just go to the route that you 've given me
so to avoid delays .
yes that 's right .
so also i would like to ask
how much the entrance fee for the sentosa ?
% uh sentosa itself is only two dollars to enter
and one dollar for your bus ride .
and when you come out-
% uh you are not given tickets when you come out ,
it 's free of charge to take the buses out .
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
aw that 's great .
now i 'm showing you universal studios now .
wow .
the lorax .
% uh i want to watch that also but % hm skip that part .
so is there an entrance fee to go on to universal studio ?
yes .
there is an entrance fee .
% uh you can buy a package .
sometimes they have-
% uh during certain promotions , they give you special prices .
but yah % um you are not coming on a public holiday , right ?
it 's not the easter weekend .
wow .
yes .
it 's an easter weekend so-
it is the easter weekend .
it 's april first mar~
yes !
i believe so .
it is .
% um can you see the prices there ?
% uh huh .
i suggest you budget at these prices first .
% uh huh .
% uh at the highest so that you , you know
it will cost you seventy four dollars % uh each for you and your girlfriend and-
% oh actually for all three of you .
so it's-
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
well % uh so i will say it 's kinda
one hundred plus singaporean dollars .
well it 's kinda , you know , it 's not expensive .
two hundred .
two hundred .
it 's two hundred and twenty two .
% uh that 's okay .
i believe it 's on the budget .
yes .
it 's all still on the budget .
and if you want to eat in chinatown at the food centre 's % uh street side
it 's very cheap .
it 's under ten dollars for each of you .
okay .
% uh noodles would be about four dollars ,
rice for five dollars the most .
% oh that 's cool . so el~
% oh that 's cool . so el~
you know what ?
i want to take a picture in front of the , you know , universal studio globe
with the fountain and i do n't know if it 's in the centre
but i want to take a picture there with them .
you can-
you will take lots of pictures in this area .
it 's very pretty .
% uh not only within universal studios but on the island as well .
okay .
so do you know how long % uh-
can you estimate how long can we vis~
you know , check out the sentosa park ?
how many hours can we see all of the sights there ?
% uh do you notice they have a two-day package and a three-day package ?
so if you were to visit all the attractions , one day is not enough .
% oh probably we will just go into one day only .
i just want to just , you know , just check out some best features in there so-
and at the same time we 're going to universal studio .
that 's right . i-
that 's right . i-
and i suggest you skip the casino .
no .
do n't worry .
i do n't gamble .
i do n't like gambling .
although for you as a tourist to enter ,
it is free of charge to enter to gamble .
you could enter just to have a look and then come out again .
well i keep my mind on that .
actually that 's my first time to see a casino also .
you might want to propose to your girlfriend first
because a visit to sentosa % uh may tire her for the next day .
so % uh propose to her
and then the second day you can bring her to universal studios .
okay .
that 's good .
so probably i 'll just change my schedules in terms of proposing to her .
yah .
that 's right .
and you 'd be very happy after you get your yes answer .
yes .
that 's right .
definitely .
what else do you think % uh you would like to do in singapore ?
well i know there 's a-
you told in the service guide that i saw in a brochure here in the philippines .
i just want to ask where to go to the merlion statue ?
okay .
the merlion statue -
% uh let me get on to the mrt map for you .
please do .
because i want to see that also .
okay .
so say you 're at your hotel here in chinatown .
you go down to the green line
and then you switch east bound to city hall .
% uh huh .
east bound ?
okay .
and you get off there .
that 's a very interesting historic area .
% uh before you go to the merlion ,
you will be passing by our supreme court and city hall .
% uh although they are now-
right now being % uh renovated to be turned into the singapore % uh art museum -
% oh sorry , the singapore -
a big museum for singaporeans to enjoy .
both of them would be combined .
% um you can walk from there towards the seaward side
and % uh you would be able to see the merlion .
you walk across a big field across from where they are renovating these two buildings .
% oh . % uh huh .
okay .
so-
% uh huh .
and you get to see views % uh of the hotel marina bay sands .
very scenic .
i see .
i believe that you told me earlier that the merlion is a historical place .
so is there any places that you know there 's an history on it ?
and % uh you know-
say again please ?
there is an historical places that we can go ?
another places ins~
% uh besides the merlion ?
are you thinking of ethnic areas % uh also ?
yes .
that 's okay .
okay .
besides chinatown -
well for history first , by the river , that 's very historic place
because % uh where the merlion is
% uh nearby is the start of the mouth of the singapore river .
and that 's where sir stamford raffles landed which he 's a british
who came here to look for a trading port .
so and the whole riverside , the buildings have been conserved .
so it 's an interesting walk , huh .
% uh you could walk in fact along the river
or you could from your hotel in chinatown take the line to little india
and soak in some indian culture in that area .
% uh huh .
i see .
okay .
i i must see it also .
it 's ki~
i believe it 's kinda few blocks
or it will just take another minutes
or is it to take to little india -
it will take for me a one hour or-
i-
to little india % uh usually two stops about 5 minutes .
but on this line .
so maybe seven or eight minutes
but % uh you have to factor in walking down to the station in getting out
so maybe twenty minutes .
% oh well that 's okay .
it 's kinda-
it 's kinda short distance .
so probably we 'll go there first before to the merlion
since it 's near in the chinatown .
is that correct ?
yes that 's right .
% uh you go there-
% uh try and go there in the morning where many people are marketing .
you can take photos of the flower garland makers ,
the % uh vegetable sellers and visit the hindu temples before twelve o'clock .
because they-
yah they close around twelve to about four o'clock
and then they reopen .
but if you missed it , you can go back later in the % uh around four something .
and it is open till nine o'clock .
and you can eat there also since you say you like chili .
i see .
before twelve , hm .
% oh , i see .
% uh huh .
yes .
i like chili but my girlfriends love sweets .
so you know kinda contradicting .
% uh but in the-
% uh little india has lots of sweets also
milk-based sweets in the same area .
you can both be very happy .
well that 's good to hear .
so probably we 'll just gon na eat there also together with his brother .
e~
there is also dessert stall in chinatown
% uh that specialises in % uh pureed sesame paste and pureed peanut paste
% uh just about one street away from where you are .
% uh huh .
okay .
so i would just like to know if there is any
beach that kinda near to chinatown
so that we can , you know , stroll , walk on the seashore ?
the area where the merlion is , is actually where we have the seafront .
% uh but the seafront that you see is now a reservoir
to collect rainwater that falls in the city area and also to prevent flooding .
% uh if you want to walk , i think on men~
sentosa % uh after you visit universal studios ,
take a walk along the beach ,
that would be better .
% uh huh .
% uh okay .
% uh huh .
yes .
okay .
thank you so much for that .
and also about the-
because you told me that .
so i guess is there any historical places that , you know , is available to see ?
historical places .
if you want-
% uh what sort of history do you want ?
war history or do you want to see a museum about % uh local lifestyle ?
well maybe a local lifestyle first ,
a cultural type .
okay .
okay that is very % um convenient
because right in chinatown , we have the chinatown heritage % uh centre
which shows you life in a building like yours but in its original form .
so it 's called the chinatown heritage centre
and it 's right where you are ,
you just walk two streets down .
% uh huh .
i see .
that 's very convenient .
thank you so much for that .
and also about the war history , where is the location of it ?
the museum of the war history ?
% uh the museum is accessible by bus and by train .
it 's called the changi prison museum or changi museum .
you take the west line % uh right down to like just hold on a minute .
okay .
you can actually go by bus all the way ,
number two bus .
and you can have sight see along the way .
but % uh if you prefer to go there faster ,
you take a train % uh to tanah merah .
% uh huh .
tanah merah .
okay .
i 'll just-
% uh huh .
sorry .
yah tanah merah .
and then you switch to number two bus .
% uh huh .
number two bus .
and you are right outside the museum .
i just want to ask .
is it okay to use my ez-link ticket to the train ?
when you'd-
when i would-
i see .
yes .
that 's what you 're buying it for ,
for the trains and buses
and the buses .
i-
okay .
i get it now .
% uh huh .
% uh because i-
so you do n't worry about % uh carrying loose change on knowing how much , you know .
so fix your problem .
% uh huh .
% uh huh .
okay .
that 's good .
okay that 's very helpful .
so is there any , you know , places that you might , you know , sightseeing
places that you can give us or recommend us wha~
a best place that we can , you know , stroll alo~
around , take pictures ?
% uh to stroll around and take pictures
would be the areas i have recommended .
% uh huh .
if you want % uh garden ,
do you like gardens % uh besides hortpark ?
also-
we have another garden that is very famous and older one .
and from harbourfront ,
you take the yellow line all the way to botanic gardens .
% uh huh .
aw .
that 's also quite romantic for proposal
but it would be busier .
i think there will be more people around and % uh-
that 's right .
it's-
also more of % uh open space
whereas if you reached hortpark and it 's raining ,
they have a big covered area near the entrance
where you can wait out the rain and you can walk to this place
where i said you can propose to your girlfriend .
okay , that 's good .
so i think that 's okay now .
well can you recommend other places besides what i 'm asking ?
you know any location that we might visited-
visiting now ?
you-
i-
another part of history that you might like to visit ,
it is % uh a museum that is near to the city hall stop .
% uh huh .
and it 's also near the merlion
and it 's called the asian civilisation 's museum .
so it gives you not only the history of singapore but of % uh-
well we have artefacts from india , from china
and also from the middle east .
% uh huh .
that 's cool .
well that 's very good to hear .
so in that same place near the merlion ,
there 's a various museum that i can go in , take some pictures .
is it allowed to take a picture inside the museum ?
% uh not inside the museum
because , you know , when you have your camera flash on ,
it 's % uh it fades the photograph-
% uh the exhibits .
and i-
maybe for security also ,
they usually do not allow photography inside .
% uh huh .
i see .
i get it now .
so probably i 'll just take a picture outside of it .
yes .
% uh inside if you want to see the history of singapore only
% uh there is a foyer on the upstairs level ,
you can take the lift or walk up the stairs .
and that 's free of charge .
okay .
so i believe that you helped me a lot in here .
well thank you so much for it .
i 'll just put to notes on everything that you told me .
and probably by the next day or so ,
we 're gon na book and go to singapore .
well thank you so much for that
and you really helped me a lot .
you are most welcome .
% uh do you need anything else ?
% uh maybe you want to go to a church or anything else ?
well i believe that 's enough .
well probably i will just try to call back to check if there 's anything e-
okay .
because in that area , we also have an anglican church , catholic churches .
% uh when you get off at city hall ,
they are all within walking distance of that area .
% uh huh .
i see .
sure .
okay .
so i 'm a christian . there-
so i 'm a christian . there-
is there any christian church there ?
% uh what sort of a christian are you ?
i 'm a-
in the philippines it 's a born again christian .
do you have any-
born again christian .
% uh i 'm not so familiar with % uh-
% oh i see .
so-
well that 's okay .
probably i will just visit the evangelic , is that correct ?
wha~
yes evangelist .
we have new creation church and new life church .
but i 'm not so good with % uh-
i 'm sorry for a-
% uh religion .
yah .
well that 's okay .
so is it okay to take a pictures inside the churches ?
% uh i am not sure about the protestant churches
but % uh in the catholic churches they allow you .
and the catholic and anglican churches have lots of statues inside ,
you know , of their saints .
% uh let me show you a picture of one of them .
okay .
please do .
you know why i keep asking for souvenirs ?
because each place that i want to go becau~
just i want to buy something there so that reminds me that we went there
and take pictures , you know .
% oh , is that the saint andrews ?
yes , saint andrews .
this is a church of england , anglican church .
% oh , it 's great .
so beautiful .
it 's a-
yah .
it 's a national monument .
and we also have a bit of war history on the walls .
% uh because % uh during the war , the british were here
and some died and so people put up plaques in church to remember them .
% uh huh .
okay .
it 's good to see .
i 'm fascinated with the infrastructure , you know ,
how they build it .
it 's just like a medieval time .
yes .
% uh it is in fact shaped like a cross if you are in a helicopter above it .
i see .
and it 's a very active church . they-
and it 's a very active church . they-
in fact they have a little sunken area nearby .
because they can not expand the church because it 's a protected building .
so there is a sunken area on the other side of the building
where they have % uh-
they use for other purposes when they have not enough space within the church .
okay .
so besides to that saint andrews church cathedral ,
do you have any loca~
different location other churches that is available ?
% uh the catholic churches are just within walking distance across the road from there .
and they were all built in the eighteen hundreds , early nineteen hundreds .
so they are a bit like this .
in fact more on it because , you know , catholics have lots of statues of saints .
and the way of the cross along the walls ,
so it 's great for photography .
the priest will allow it .
% uh huh .
wow .
yah .
i really must bring my camera there .
so i just want to ask since % um-
in chinatown , i want to know how to get there in saint andrews .
and you know take pictures in it .
% oh you just take the % uh line to city hall station .
% uh huh .
and when you get off ,
i believe there 's even a sign to tell you where this building is .
% oh , that 's great .
yah .
so maybe at the first day of our trip
maybe i should go there first .
and besides the churches ,
well at night , is there any li~
bars , you know-
besides in chinatown , is there any locations that accommodates a ,
you know , bars -
night bars , you know , kind-
night market .
do you have a night market in singapore that we might-
the night market would be in chinatown
but the bars i would suggest along the singapore river .
% uh you just walk along the river .
there are many % uh restaurants and some are just-
you know sports bars where they watch % uh games ?
there 's a huge tv screen and you can watch international matches .
and then % uh some of them are supported by certain people who like certain teams .
and they go and cheer their team on .
although that is not held in singapore .
so there 's a great atmosphere there .
i would suggest along the singapore river .
% uh huh .
i see .
sure .
and i want to know also ,
is there any bars that affordable ?
you know what i mean .
that the-
again as i said the prices there are quite competitive
because there are so many of them .
so you can just walk along and % uh you can in fact ask the prices before you go in .
% uh in fact some of them , they just put up a sign to say % uh so many dollars for a jug of beer .
% uh ten of fifteen dollars because they want to show that they are not expensive .
% uh huh ?
% uh huh .
% oh that 's good .
there's-
they even have a promotions in bars
so that 's great .
yes .
% uh so , you know , because people like you have the same idea
that it looks expensive .
because expatriate community are also seen there .
yes , % hm .
but it 's not actually .
% uh there is one bar i like there .
it 's called % uh penny black .
you know the first stamp in the world is called the penny black ?
penny black .
% oh , i ju-
and-
% uh it 's at the start of the river .
% uh you can also eat there if you like .
they have got very good fish and chips if you % uh do n't mind
eating that . not very singaporean .
eating that . not very singaporean .
i-
go on .
so this is the different-
various bars and restaurants that-
yes .
okay .
can you see on your screen the three quays we have along the river ?
% uh huh .
so boat quay is at the start of the river .
yes .
% oh , okay .
and the penny black is there right at the start .
it 's quite an old bar .
and you find lots of people there .
it 's affordable .
it 's not expensive .
and then-
% oh that 's good .
and at clarke quay , % uh lots of places to eat .
% uh retail shops .
% uh at clarke quay , you get many retail shops besides the bars and the restaurants .
this is just like a food court and shopping centre , is that correct ?
the clarke quay ?
an-
no .
not at clarke quay .
clarke quay is a bit more upscale than a food court .
% ah okay .
okay .
i just-
if you-
if you want a market , go to maxwell market in chinatown .
aw .
okay thank you .
there the food will cost only about three to five dollars a dish
depending on % uh what is inside the dish .
okay .
and clarke quay is-
and boat quay -
we also have robertson quay .
these places are best visited in the evenings .
i must see that also .
i know i believe the-
twenty nine , thirty , thirty one , i believe for four days only
and it 's kinda hard to visit all the locations here .
but i must put my itinerary or my time here .
so that 's good .
robertson 's quay .
so this is all besides the shore ?
is that correct ?
% uh along the river .
along the river .
okay .
i 'm sorry for that .
i-
so from the merlion , you go to boat quay first .
and then you go to clarke quay .
% uh huh .
and robertson quay is the last quay there .
it 's more laid back .
it 's a little bit quieter here at robertson quay .
% oh okay .
okay .
that 's good .
so i would like to know since we 're going on a travel .
we 're getting exhausted .
is there any spas that we can stay and get pampered ?
yes .
in chinatown , there are spas to-
in fact sometimes they will stop you as you are walking
% uh normal price is about % uh ninety eight dollars for one hour .
% uh full body massage but
sometimes they will offer it first time trial for thirty eight dollars .
i believe that 's enough for-
i think that 's % uh affordable with my budget
because , you know , we 're just going stroll around in the loca-
different location that you just told me .
so probably the main problem-
the main thing that we need is the food .
so you 've given me a lot of that .
and is there anything else that we can visit
besides the quay parks in the robertson quay , you know ?
is there any locations that , you know , we can go visit ?
% uh you can just walk by yourself to visit the hindu temples in little india .
in chinatown , we have a fairly new temple called the buddha tooth relic temple .
and the oldest temple which is one street away called teluk-
at teluk ayer street is called % um thian hock keng temple .
and it 's within walking distance from where you are .
well the hotel that i book is probably the most nicest place
because , you know , i can go to the little india
without even bothering where should i go .
and is there any malls that we can , you know , can visit ?
are you talking about shopping malls ?
one of the-
yes .
one of the famous just ,
you know , just want to look at also .
there are very many famous malls in singapore
but-
well just recome~
but for me just recommend what you know .
because you know this is my first time to go in there .
so probably the best thing is you just recommend me
and have a look and s~
maybe later i will search for it .
is that okay ?
okay . um-
okay . um-
sorry .
as you are going to sentosa
% uh just before you come back ,
if you take the light rail instead of the bus out ,
it 's only a small fee , two dollars also i think .
you get off at vivo city .
it 's spelt v i v o city .
and it 's a huge shopping mall .
so wait ,
what you see on the screen is the buddha tooth relic temple and museum
which is walking distance from your hotel .
okay .
v i , % um % hm .
it 's kinda na~
neat place .
and it is near in our hotel , right ?
yes .
you just walk there .
so you buy your souvenirs and you end up at a % uh temple and the museum .
% uh now you want to have-
do you want to see the other temple ?
i show it to you .
the thian hock keng temple .
so-
% uh huh .
this is-
you see this temple is a bit new .
the other temple is % uh two streets away .
but you really should walk there because that 's the nearest place .
and you can see % uh the oldest or well-
one of the oldest temples in singapore .
% uh huh .
okay .
% um i believe you 've helped me a lot now .
well i 'll just keep the notes from everything that you 've given me .
and i would like to thank you for this
because i believe that my budget for staying there is enough for-
to accommodate to everything that you-
the location that i might visit .
well okay .
% um i must end my call now because i 'm going to work already .
well thank you so much again .
% uh okay .
you 're welcome .
so entry to the temples or mosque , the hindu
temples , the churches are all free of charge .
okay .
okay .
bye .
okay .
thank you .
alright .

% uh singapore flyer is located on the southern part of singapore .
and % uh it will take you approximately about forty minutes
to % uh do this % um % uh to give you panoramic view of the marina bay area
as well as the % uh financial district area of singapore .

% uh you can either take % uh the whole day , it 's fine .
% um unless it is raining , then otherwise % uh morning you get a different kind of view .
evening if you 're taking at night that 's also nice ,
because then you see the lights coming on
% um in the southern part of singapore .
so either morning , it 's a bright morning .
% uh afternoon , it 's same .
at night if you want to see the lights then , yes .
then go on % uh the singapore flyer when you are % uh in the night time , okay .
this is the night scene out here .
% hm i see .
and the first picture will be the day scene .
wow , that 's great .
% um is that a tube , it 's like a tube , right ?

% uh a chew ?
% eh , % uh a chew , the one that you 're going ride in .
% uh sorry , i do n't understand .
% uh i mean the-
it 's like a tube , the fly-
yes .
% oh a tube ?
% oh okay , yes it 's a capsule .
is , yah , it 's a glass capsule .
% um let me try and see-
okay .
let me just show you how the capsules looks like .
okay , yah .
okay , now you can see here this picture .
% uh okay this people are actually inside this capsule .
so it can actually take in about % uh twenty people in one capsule , yah .
yes .
twenty people .
so it 's a glass , yah .
it 's glass % uh i will say , it looks like a bag .
yah .
okay , so this is the singapore flyer .
wow .
% um what about the dining ?
% um are we allowed to % um take a % uh even % um for example dinner or lunch ?
okay on normal days , we do n't provide % uh dining
in the capsule .
this will be provided for special occasions
like for example valentine 's day , yes we do % um % uh lunch or dinner
that is provided inside this flyer .
yes , that 's the capsule .
a photo of the capsule .
% um otherwise if you just want to bring a bit of a snack ,
that 's actually fine as well .
% oh i see .
% um how much it will cost % um for two people ?
yah .
okay , the singapore flyer will cost you twenty nine dollars and fifty cents
% uh for one person for an adult .
the child will cost you twenty dollars and sixty five cent .
so that would be for two person will be twenty nine ,
% uh fifty times two for two adults .
okay .
% um that will be how long again ?
it 's twenty minutes ' ride ?
yah , that 's right .
twenty minutes , % oh that 's great .
yah .
alright .
% um moving forward , % um what about in universal studio ?
% um what attraction are available to see ?
okay , for the universal studio , there are lots of attractions there .
we have seven zones that you can see .
okay , as you can see now on the screen , there are seven zones , alright .
there are rides like roller coaster
if you 're looking to be very exciting .
roller coaster if you-
madagascar and our latest ride would be the transformer .
the first picture over here .
okay , so this is something i think the whole family will enjoy .
% uh interesting ride .
% oh , yes .
alright , i see .
yes , % um in % uh-
what about in roller coaster % um ,
how much it will cost me if ever ?
okay , the price that you pay for admission to the universal studio includes
% uh almost all the rides in universal studio .
% hm , so-
alright ?
so , yes that is already included .
all the rides ?
yes .
and how much is that ?
yes .
okay , the universal admission is sixty eight dollars for weekday .
seventy four dollars for weekends and holidays .
child will be fifty dollars % uh and fifty four for % uh public holidays and sundays -
% uh weekends .
so % um lynnette % um what is the nearest hotel
for the location that we would love to go to ?
okay , closest hotel of course would be on sentosa island .
we have a few % uh resort that is located on the island .
for example % uh we have % um-
okay , i 'm going to show you the hotels , okay ?
crockford hotel , % uh hotel michael , hardrock hotel , festive hotel , equarius and beach villas .
these are located just in the whole of resort world .
okay , so if you 're talking about very close ,
these are the hotels .
do you want me to provide you the price range ?
yes please .
% uh much bet~
the price range for this hotel is in the range of about four hundred and above .
four hundred dollars ?
and above for one room .
but they are-
it 's quite expensive .
yes .
% um what about
because these are resort hotels .
what about % um % uh i mean it 's not % um-
just not near in the universal studio ?
what about % uh one ride or at least we can save more money .
% um a three-star hotel is okay or even the one , two-star hotel .
alright , there is a very % uh a hotel , small hotel that is quite near to % uh-
on the mainland that is quite near to the % uh harbourfront
where you will take the sentosa express to get on to the universal studio .
and the name of this hotel is harbourville .
harbourville .
% um do you have any idea how much it will cost us % um for two days with two adults ?
okay .
okay , this one is in the region of % uh approximately % uh about a hundred and fifteen dollars .
per night ?
yes , per night .
okay , this is the hotel .
it 's just a small hotel % uh no % uh restaurant facilities .
yes it 's about a hundred and twenty five dollars .
so if you are talking about very close and this hotel is possible to walk to the % uh harbourfront .
wow .
okay , now if you wan na a lit~
something a little bit better
% uh i would say this hotel % uh just about % uh one stop away
% uh from the harbourfront .
okay there is this hotel called m hotel .
okay .
okay it 's located in the financial district area .
okay .
so this would be % uh a nicer hotel , alright .
it is still convenient to get there .
but otherwise % uh most of the hotels are even in orchard road
is not that difficult to get to the harbourfront .
% oh i see .
so % eh this one in m hotel , how much it will cost us ?
% uh this would be in the region of two hundred over % uh dollars .
two hundred dollars per night ?
two hundred plus .
two hundred plus .
yes .
that will be per night , right ?
yes , correct .
% hm % um wh~
per night means you check-in at three o'clock , two o'clock , three o'clock ,
and you will have to leave the hotel by twelve the next day .
% oh i see .
so that is % um the check-in advice us to stay for two days .
% um i think we can-
can you check for me about % um my budget is only eighty dollars to one hundred dollars per night .
okay , % uh eighty dollars .
do you mind staying in a backpackers ' hotel ?
yah , i do n't see any problem with that .
okay , we do have % uh backpackers ' hotel in singapore .
okay .
okay there are quite a lot of % uh backpackers ' hotel in singapore .
now , % uh again depending on the % uh location that is-
location .
yes , that you want to stay .
okay , i 'm giving you some list here of the hotels for backpackers ' .
they are all below a hundred dollars .
% hm that 's great .
% um much better as well if we get % um just % uh close
to the area that we 'd love to go .
yah .
as close as possible ?
yes .
okay , then i would say that % uh there is a hotel called the inns over in chinatown .
i think that would be very close already
% uh to the % uh harbourfront .
% oh so % um for that wha~
% um for that hotel , it will only cost me less than a dollar ?
yes .
% uh less than one hundred dollars .
yes , that 's right .
so that is good for two or only-
okay , i 'm showing you now this % uh that inn over at temple street .
% uh it will be for % uh one person .
the rates .
that 's great .
yah .
yes , you are right in the heart of chinatown .
and is that near in the dining area , like a restaurant ?
okay , because this hote~
% uh this % uh hotel is located in chinatown ,
so there are lots of dining options .
there are % um % uh restaurants ,
quite a lot of chinese restaurants including dimsum , just next street
and all the lanes around the chinatown area .
but if you like to have % um street food ,
there is a street food call the chinatown complex .
and over there % um they serve % uh local food ,
and one meal let 's say if you are just having the % uh rice with three dishes ,
that will cost you approximately about five singapore dollars .
so with a drink it 's less than seven dollars , you could have a full meal .
wow .
wow .
lovely .
yah .
so that is the nearest , right ?
% um if ever that % um we are in the inn hotel % eh at % uh temple street ,
% um how long it will for us to go to sentosa , singapore flyer ?
and what will be the ride that we can use to go there ?
tem~
okay , % uh this is very conveniently located .
% uh the closest one of course would be the chinatown mrt .
the other ho~
% uh mrt would be tanjong pagar .
now tanjong pagar is actually the east-west line that you will take
to go to the % um harbourfront , alright ?
% uh but if you are , sorry .
% uh , no you take the chinatown % uh station and go to the harbourfront .
% um but let say you are going to take % uh to the singapore flyer ,
then you will have to take from tanjong pagar and alight at the city hall
and you take a walk about fifteen min~
seventeen minutes ' walk to the singapore flyer .
okay .
okay .
% oh i see .
so % um in sentosa , we just need to take the same subway , right ?
% uh on sentosa island , we do n't have subway .
% uh we have what we call the sentosa buses , that you can board .
% uh it 's all included in your ticket .
and you can also board the train on sentosa itself ,
we call it the sentosa express .
okay .
% um i see .
% um what about lynnette % um , do we need to get a visa for this ?
% um for example we just need to go there for a % uh two days trip .
do we need to get a visa ?
a visa coming in to singapore or a visa to sentosa ?
% oh i see .
% uh which % uh visa are you talking about ?
% um from here in our country to-
for us to go to singapore .
okay for your % uh and you are % uh holding a philippine passport ?
yes .
okay , you wo n't require a visa to come to singapore .
and sentosa island is our , one of our island .
so it 's part of singapore .
so there 's no visa requirement .
% oh that 's great .
so do you have any idea how much it will cost for a round trip ticket ?
% uh the flight tickets ?
yes .
okay , again i think it depends on which airline that you are taking .
% uh ya really very much depending of the airlines that you are taking .
or would you be able to-
% um do you have any % um-
can you give me at least % um not quite expensive ,
% uh but % um more affordable airlines that we can buy a ticket ?
more affordable airlines coming to singapore ?
yes .
yes .
% uh i would think % uh do you have budget airlines coming in ?
actually our budget % um is one thousand singaporean dollars .
okay .
% uh you have the cebupacific airlines coming into singapore ?
yes , we do .
yes , i think that would be a cheaper ticket coming in from % um singapore .
coming in to singapore .
i see .
so % um what about % um the weather or do you have any advance weather forecast
% um for the specific date that we 'll % uh like to go ?
% uh we have the same kind of temperature throughout the whole year .
% uh so there 's no % uh really specific time .
okay , maybe i 'll just give you a run down % um .
i would say that it will be good to time your holidays % uh together with our major festivals here
like february or january period will be chinese new year .
% uh it gives you that festive mood .
and % uh the hari raya sometime in % uh august , alright ?
deepavali -
august ?
yes , sometime in november .
and christmas time is also a very festive because ,
% uh we light up the whole street of orchard road .
so it gives you that very festive mood .
% um the rest of the hari raya , deepavali , we light up other streets in singapore .
so that gives you a very good a photography area for you to bring home
% uh some memories of singapore .
yes , some souvenir picture .
% um what about this coming april ?
you do n't have any festival ?
yah .
yah .
yah , we do n't have major festival in the month of april .
so % um % uh we also like to go to singapore night safari .
% um can you tell me more about that % eh ?
% um how long % um it will take for us to go there from the hotel that you gave it to u~
% uh to the hotel that you gave it to me ?
yes .
okay , you will have to % uh-
the mrt ride will take you approximately about forty five minutes
to get to the northern part of singapore .
and you will alight at the mrt train station called the ang mo kio station .
and from there , you change a bus number one three eight ,
to get to the night safari .
so it will be better for you to allocate at least about one and a half hours
from the hotel to the night safari park .
% oh i see .
so % um in the night safari , % um what time the park will be open ?
the park will be open from % uh seven thirty in the night time
to twelve midnight .
twelve midnight ?
yes .
how much it will be % um the entrance fee ?
the entrance fee will be thirty two dollars for an adult ,
and a child will be twenty one dollars .
that already include the tram ride ?
yes , the tram ride is included % uh for the % uh price that i have quoted you .
% hm i see .
that 's great .
% um are we allowed to feed the animals or something ?
okay , this is a wild park .
that means the animals are not tame ,
so % uh yes we do not % uh encourage anyone to feed the animals .
they are well-taken care of % uh by the zoo keepers .
% uh and they have % uh regular feeding time .
so we do n't want the animals to put on too much weight .
and they will be eating the wrong kind food if we give them the human food .
so they have special % uh food that the zoo keepers will feed them .
so strictly no feeding .
% um and also % uh we-
for the night safari , because these animals , most of the animals are nocturnal creatures .
% uh so if you 're going to take photography % uh on the animals ,
then please switch off your % um flashlights .
% oh i see .
% hm so fla~
the flash of to the camera is not allowed for-
when we take pictures ?
% uh we do not % uh want to damage the eyes of these % uh nocturnal creatures ,
because being nocturnal creatures , they have very sharp % uh eyesight .
so we do n't want to damage % uh their eyes .
and that 's why we do n't want any flash photographies on the animals .
but if you want to take pictures of your friends or % uh just the backdrop , % uh without the animals ,
yes , then you can take % uh pictures with the flash .
flash , i see that great .
% um do you have any idea what is the highlights of the safari par~
% uh the nig~
the safari ?
do you ha~
% hm yes the highlight of course % eh some of the rarer animals that we do n't get to see so close
% uh to us .
i would be-
you see this tram ride ?
on the tram ride the malayan tapir comes very close to the tram , right ?
but please keep all your-
any parts of your body to yourself .
do not stretch them out .
do not touch the animals because they are wild animals .
so this is something interesting as well as and of course on the tram ride ,
the deers will also come very close to the tram , alright .
so these are , i would say , interesting and highlight .
% um the other highlight would be the leopards that you can see up close % uh to you .
yah ,
% uh so you are actually just separated by the % um leopards .
yah , by a glass enclosure , okay ?
so you can see that on the screen now .
they 're so-close to the leopards and i think % uh it 's going to be a real highlight .
okay .
yes .
cool .
wow .
le~
yes .
yah .
wow that 's great .
yah .
so you can see % uh the spots , alright ?
every spot of the leopard .
% uh so i think there are lot of nice % uh animals that you can see but ,
% uh i would say % uh personally for me , i think these are very exciting .
yes .
yes , i was actually i 'm so excited right now .
% um my husband and i planning to go there on his birthday
this coming april .
so i 'm looking forward to saw this leopard as well .
yah .
yes .
but % uh in order to see this leopard ,
you will have to walk % uh , remember just now the tram ride ?
okay , now when you are in the night safari , you get on the tram ride .
now in the middle of the tram ride , there is a stop
so you can get off and do a short walk for about thirty minutes
and you get to see the leopard up close and personal .
now , when you finish this walk , just come back to the main entrance
and board another tram and that would bring you back to the main entrance .
now , again on the screen you can see there is fishing cat trail .
if you 're not too tired , you can do this trail and the trail would take you about twenty minutes .
and again the last trail it will be the forest giant trail , right .
so these are the three % uh trails % uh that you can do % um for the % uh tour over in the night safari .
okay , so it 's up to you whether you are too tired , you do n't feel like walking ,
on the tram ride you see seventy per cent of the animals .
wow .
yes .
yah .
wow .
i do n't think so that we 'll be % uh feel tired if ever that we go there .
yes .
yah .
the thi~
i mean this is the first time % um that we 're planning to go to singapore .
so i do n't think so that we feel tired .
so % um % uh % um we also-
you also have a shows , right ?
night shows .
yes .
we have a night shows at the % um % uh night safari park .
we call it the creatures of the night show .
okay .
and % um it 's a different % uh from a circus show .
we 'll just show you some of the animals that will be coming up .
% hm wow .
wow lovely .
alright .
yes there you see the zoo keeper ?
alright bringing up not the % uh lions .
just the smaller animals % uh for you to see % uh a little bit closer , alright ?
% um so they will be just doing % um what they normally do like feeding , you know , how do they
% uh take their food .
% um , yah .
so these are just things that they do .
otherwise this is the fire show .
% uh it is comes on every night , % um and they will be performing at the front-
at the entrance of the night safari park .
now to see the creatures of the night show , normally it 's a long queue ,
% uh so you have to queue there , % uh you have to be % uh % um at the queuing up for this show a little bit early .
usually % uh more than half an hours in advance .
okay .
% oh wha~
more than hour in advance ?
yes .
and so % um that will only cost me again , how much ?
okay , their show is included .
so % uh if you want to see this show
is they are all included in their admission ticket .
okay , the sh~
so we also allowed to % um-
% uh what about in the show itself ?
are we allowed to touch % um the small lion ?
% uh no .
% uh like i sa~
mention , all the animals in the night safari park are wild animals .
so only the zoo keepers allowed to touch them .
% oh only the zoo keeper .
yes , because they are still wild animals .
so % um in the spend tim~
i mean span time from six p.m . is that right ?
the night safari starts at seven thirty a~
seven thirty ?
yes and it % uh-
until twelve midnight ?
twelve midnight , yes .
are we able to go there to all these % uh beautiful spot that you show me ?
yes , you % uh-
from seven thirty to twelve midnight ,
you definitely have a lot of time % uh to see everything in the night safari park .
but i do n't % uh-
you do n't really need to stay until twelve p.m .
i thought do we need to stay until twelve midnight .
% uh not necessary , about three hours is already good enough .
so it 's enough .
three hours is okay , right ?
for three hours is actually % uh enough
% uh to see everything in the night safari park .
% um but if it 's % um we go there for about seven thirty p.m .
for three hours that will be around ten thirty ?
yes , you can leave at about ten thirty .
that is sufficient .
is that safe to travel again to go back to the hotel ?
yes .
% uh ten thirty you can still take the public bus .
% uh one three eight back to the ang mo kio mrt train station
and from there take % uh % um a train back to your hotel .
now , in singapore it 's pretty safe to travel around in the night .
but as usual , anywhere else in the world , you just avoid all the dark lanes
% um and do not % uh carry too much cash with you , that 's all .
alright ?
yes .
but-
so that 's great to hear .
so % um i will make sure that i will go the singapore night safari .
okay , and we have our latest of addition , we have a baby giraffe that is just born .
in our night safari .
yah .
wow .
so how old this the giraffe ?
the giraffe is just a few months old .
few months old ?
yah .
still we 're not allowed to carry them ?
% uh no .
like i mention all our animals are wild animals .
so % uh it 's not-
they are not tame at all .
alright ?
so for this one % um we only have three beautiful spots in singapore
that we love to go to
do you have any idea or any suggestion that we can % um as well to at least to-
i mean to go to as well ?
% uh sorry , what do you say ?
i mean do you have any suggestion that we % um
or do you have any idea that-
another spot in singapore that we can go to ?
% um aside from singapore flyer in sentosa and sing~
in safari .
do you have suggestion for us ?
okay , do you-
do you like to do a little bit of sport , extreme sport ?
like for example rock climbing ?
% hm that 's great .
okay , we have % uh this rock climbing right in the heart of orchard road .
it 's called borderx .
borderx ?
yes , it 's rock climbing .
but it 's on a wall actually .
and you will be in a building .
wow .
borderx , alright .
and it 's right in the heart of the shopping belt .
do we have % um safety gear for that ?
yes , of course .
you need safety gear to climb up this wall .
okay , this is borderx .
okay , i am showing you the location it 's right in the heart of the orchard road .
the mrt train station will be somerset station .
okay , now let me just try and show you the photograph of this borderx .
this one lynnette is % um we 're going to climb a building , right ?
yes , % uh a wall i would say .
how-
a wall , how tall is that ?
% uh it 's about three-story tall .
again it depends on % uh how is your fitness level .
i do n't think so that i can get there on the top .
okay , so yes we do have % uh the trainers that will be % uh teaching you
how to climb at this wall , alright ?
wow , that 's great .
yah , so this is-
yah , just going to show you .
how much is this ?
% uh i mean how much it will cost us again for this % um-
i think this is the best for me .
and the-
if ever this is my first time that i will climb a wall .
okay .
% uh it should be in the region of thirty four % uh dollars .
thirty four dollars .
yes .
are you quite fit ?
% um maybe my partner .
i do n't think so that i can do that .
okay .
okay , yes .
now , i 'm showing you .
you see they are climbing up this wall .
% hm that 's great .
okay , it 's thirty three dollars for the % uh-
okay they just want to experience the climbing is twenty three for weekday and twenty eight % uh for weekend .
for weekends , huh .
% uh yes and all the climbing gear , the safety gear , will all be provided .
wow that 's great .
and that is open from ?
yah .
so it 's open from monday to friday ,
% uh one to ten p.m .
okay .
what about saturday and sunday ?
saturday , sunday would be from eleven to ten p.m .
% oh that 's great .
so this is the wall ?
yah , it 's a thirty-metre vertical wall .
% hm i think it 's hard to climb .
okay , i think you have to be a little bit fit for this .
i do n't think so .
okay .
so this is % uh something that 's exciting out here .
yes .
it 's quite exci~
% um what about the shoppi~
% um the mall area ?
% um are we allowed to % um-
i mean , what part of the singapore can we buy some souvenirs
that we can bring home ?
okay .
% uh well if you like food because a lot of the local people like to eat out here .
we have something % uh quite interesting .
it 's a kind of cookie and inside you have this % um pineapple % um paste in there ,
so it 's called pineapple tarts .
now , all the other races , the major races , we cook this or we bake this pineapple tart .
but all of us use a different recipe .
so you 'll be able to pick up this % uh from the bakery shop ,
they would have % uh the pineapple tarts .
otherwise if you enjoy meat , okay , like pork ,
% uh we have this barbecue pork slices , % uh so you can get them from this shop
that specia~
or even you see them barbecuing meat , it 's marinated meat ,
so it has that tinge of sweetness in a meat and you can buy them back home , alright ?
some of them are vacuum packed as well , so it 's very easy for you to bring home
% uh to your country .
wow .
wow that 's great .
what about % um an exotic food ?
yah .
% uh exotic , like how exotic ?
% oh li~
crocodile meat ?
yes , something like that .
turtle meat ?
yes we do have them here .
but of course you have to look specially for the restaurants .
% uh for turtle soup , you will have to go to some of this % uh non-air-conditioned coffee shops .
% uh where they serve this % uh herbal turtle soup .
coffee shop .
% um the-
what is the best % um food that you can advice to us ?
well , they have so many interesting food out here .
so it 's really difficult to talk about the best % uh food .
% um so maybe can we be a little bit more specific ?
% um i love heavy meal .
more unique to singapore ?
sorry , what did you like to have ?
% uh i love heavy meal .
heavy meal ?
yes .
heavy meal .
i love rice , % um meat , fish .
okay , so you are a foodie % uh ?
yes .
okay , maybe i will say % uh things food that we have here in singapore that you do n't readily get them
in % uh philippines , right ?
maybe % uh fried hokkien noodles ?
you can get them in our food centre whether air-conditioned or non-air-conditioned .
so something that is easily available and i would say
our majority of the local % uh favourite food .
fried hokkien noodle , okay .
so i 'm going to give you this , alright .
so % uh this is the-
let me just show you .
wow .
% hm i see .
% hm that 's great .
so this is a fried hokkien fro~
% uh fried hokkien prawn .
yah , it 's actually with a bit of seafood like % uh kara mani ,
% um , okay .
okay , i 'm gon na show you some of the food now .
i think it 's a little bit small here .
so some-
wow .
yes , okay now , yah .
this is fried hokkien noodles , fried with prawn , kara mani and it 's yellow noodle and white noodle .
okay , so this is one i think you do n't get them back home .
okay , yah .
another yes , you can see , right ?
so it 's tasty .
yah its look delicious .
yah .
and another dish that i would like to recommend you will be fried carrot cake .
this is a savoury food .
okay , it 's savoury .
it 's actually white radish .
you can see it 's actually white radish % um cooked with rice flour
and that is the black version .
it 's has been cooked with black soya sauce , black sauce .
% oh i see .
black sauce .
yah so it has a tinge of sweetness in there .
the white colour will be savoury .
so i do n't think you get this food back home .
so i like to just recommend you this two food ,
and of course a lot more % um % uh food that we have .
wow , it's-
yes , i love to try it actually .
i 'm hungry right now .
yah , so-
yah , so it 's not the normal % uh orange carrot , % uh .
it 's actually white radish but we can call it the fried carrot cake .
so a lot more % uh % um food that i recommend , but like i said
i think these are two , just two recipes that you may not get them at home .
two , yah .
but % um i 'm sure we will try that .
yes .
% uh if you get from the % uh non-air-conditioned food centre , we call it hawker centre .
one plate of this would cost you only three dollars .
% ah s~
wow .
yah .
it 's quite cheap .
% uh i mean three dollars for that % um fried carrot cake .
yes .
yes .
yah , you can have it for either breakfast , lunch or dinner .
% hm lovely .
so % um one more question .
% um what about % um a bar or that we can go to ?
% um that will be % um of course % uh we will love ,
if it 's % um near in the hotel .
okay , now singapore is not that big .
so everywhere you travel give yourself one hour is more than sufficient .
generally it should be a travelling time about half an hour .
okay , there are so many clubs % uh that are very good .
% uh again it depends on price range .
so i will give you % uh some of the clubs % uh that you can do in singapore .
% uh % huh , yes .
that 's great .
and also % um much better if it 's more affordable .
okay .
but most important % uh they are very good clubs , right ?
yes .
okay , this is a zouk , alright
it 's a very famous in singapore .
% um it 's just about half an hour % uh distance-
% uh travelling time for you .
wow , great .
okay , and % uh the budget there it's-
well can range from forty to hundred dollars .
it 's a very good dance club .
% um next door there is % uh the younger % uh ,
i would say the younger brother % uh of zouk , okay .
so there are two clubs there that you can do .
otherwise you can go to saint james powerstation .
okay , there are three clubs here ; zouk , phuture , and devil underground .
% uh you can also go to saint james powerstation .
there are quite a few clubs there as well .
wow .
okay .
so you want something more affordable , right ?
yes .
because of course % uh we need to % um budget the money that we have .
okay , this is an entertainment complex .
% um so there are quite a few clubs there % uh that you can % uh do .
clubs .
that 's great .
what about the entrance fee , % um do they have entrance fee ?
yes , they do have .
so generally out there , okay , it 's a bit noisy-
now , i 'm going to turn off this .
okay , now % uh there are entrance fee , so again it depends on which particular club you want to go to .
over at saint james it range from about forty dollars up to a hundred .
% uh then of course there more expensive club % uh world famous like % uh ku dé ta
% uh that 's over at marina .
you 're familiar with this club ?
% um actually no .
okay .
so maybe is something a little bit more affordable would be this club .
okay , let me give you this .
wow that 's great .
so the best % um beverage in singapore % um that we would love to taste it ,
% um can you give me % um-
any suggestion for that ?
% uh are you talking about alcoholic or non-alcohol ?
yes , alcoholic .
alcoholic , okay .
for alcohol % uh we have a very good selection of wines , % uh from all over the world .
% um from shiraz , pinot noir .
okay , so really hard to pinpoint .
so we have so many % uh variety % uh of % uh wine here in singapore .
okay , cocktail-wise again a very good selection and in fact some of the clubs that you 're gon na visit ,
they would have their own concoction .
so really difficult .
but one of our local % uh cocktail , yes .
% uh that would be the singapore sling .
wines .
wow .
local , yes .
singapore sling ?
singapore gin sling , yes .
gin sling .
% uh it 's locally concocted .
% um so it 's a little mild kind of a cocktail drink pink in colour .
wow .
yah so that is something % uh that is local % um otherwise a very good selection of wine
and like i said cocktail .
so it 's going to be too wide % uh to let you know like which % uh cocktail to recommend to you .
recommend .
but i think % um i would love to % um try % um for the singapore sling gin .
yah .
yes it 's a gin sling % uh that would be something that is locally concocted .
% uh , yah .
so the other club that i recommend you which is a little bit cheaper would be double o .
okay , that is at queen street .
yah .
double o .
and , wow that 's great .
that will be a little bit % uh cheaper .
okay , unfortunately i do n't think the website is on .
okay , let see whether this-
okay , yup , this is double o .
double o .
yah , so it will be a bit cheaper compared to zouk .
okay ?
i think zouk is first class , right ?
alright .
yes , it 's a well-known club .
% uh a lot of % um tourist , % uh local likes to visit this club .
% oh i see , that 's great .
yah .
so this one i think it 's more affordable than the zouk , right ?
yah , this is like cheaper .
wow that 's great .
that 's great to hear .
yah .
so you can do two clubs , alright .
one per night .
yah .
that 's great to hear lynnette .
so % um i think i have all the information that i need .
% um thank you or all your help .
right .
okay , thank you for calling and % uh we hope to see you in singapore soon .
% oh i see , that 's great to hear .
so % um i also would like to meet you as well .

and this is lynnette .
hi , good morning .
this is participant number twenty four and this warren .
warren ?
yup .
hi warren .
hi .
% oh the reason why i 'm calling is i want to go ont~
into singapore and could you help me ?
sure .
but % uh maybe you-
can you give me a little bit of detail as to
% uh what you would like % uh to do or see % uh out here
or what are your interest .
and i would be able to recommend you the correct % uh things .
alright .
% hm well actually i have no idea
% hm where to go in singapore .
but can you give me at least five to ten hottest places there ?
okay .
hot as in hotspots like % uh the dance clubs ?
yup % uh .
i mean the-
so you are-
tourist-
i mean hotspot tourist destination there in singapore .
okay .
% uh but do you have special interest ?
% oh for ex~
% um i love to go into beach , mountains , and like theme parks .
% hm historical places , like that .
okay sure .
alright .
i will start with % uh-
okay , i will start with let say % uh
you 're talking about mountains .
yup .
well we do not have mountains in singapore .
% uh but what we have would be % uh bukit timah hill .
it 's not very difficult to climb .
bukit timah .
so maybe-
hill .
% oh bukit timah hill , okay .
yah .
now bukit timah hill , i 'm just going to show you
some images of the bukit timah hill .
okay , and this is just a hill .
% um it 's a nice walk up % uh in the morning
you get to meet some of the local-
quite a lot of the local like to climb this hill as well .
% um and it 's basically a very easy walk .
but of course if you want a more challenging walk up the hill
then you can do the trail .
alright , but please do not get off % uh the normal walking trails .
yes and you get to see of course some of these % um bir~
butterflies % uh flora and fauna
and you see all these people enjoying themselve
climbing up the hill .
yah .
% oh i get it .
okay .
you see i got the view in here .
yes .
so it 's quite a nice walk .
you can do a relaxing % uh walk up or you can do % uh a more challenging up , you know ,
with all these steps up this hill .
and of course there are some monkeys that you will see along the way .
okay ?
so this is the bukit timah hill .
% um but mountain climbing , like i said we do n't have mountains here ,
this is only a hill .
so this is one of the % uh items that i would like to recommend you .
but of course again if you want something a little bit more challenging ,
we do have a weight-
% uh sorry .
% uh cable ski in the % uh eastern part of singapore .
we have this % uh cable skiing out there .
as well as the beach % uh over on the eastern part of singapore .
% oh so-
so-
okay .
oh % hm .
% oh may-
so how long it will take if-
from singa~
from airport singapore to in that place ?
% uh which place ?
the bukit timah hill ?
% oh actu~
okay % uh , yup ?
% uh as much as possible , i 'll try to minimise
my time travel here
because % uh may be one day two-day
so i could , yes .
that 's the only days that i could go there .
right .
% uh okay .
but % uh you are going to stay % uh that means somewhere convenient for you to travel
to all these places , right ?
okay , what i would like to recommend you to stay would be
well , since you sounds a little bit like a more adventurer person ,
well you can % uh-
do you mind staying in a backpackers ' hotel ?
% oh okay , so-
i mean % eh is that not expensive , right ?
yes , it 's not expensive .
you could get % uh a bed space
% uh for as cheap as less than fifty dollars ,
singapore dollars .
% uh twenty five dollars , alright .
and they are quite a lot of this backpackers ' % uh hotel .
% uh and a few of them , in fact quite a number of them are located in very good co~
% uh locations .
you are just about five , ten minutes ' walk to the mrt , the subway .
% oh great .
wow .
good .
alright , yah .
how about the % uh other places for examples the beach ?
okay .
% uh the beach ?
% uh east coast we do have beaches out there
but % uh the sand there will not be like totally small white sand .
% uh no we do n't have that kind of sand out on the mainland .
% uh it 's just a place where the local people chill out ,
over the weekend .
% um do a sport of fishing .
% uh otherwise the better waters would be in our southern islands
or on sentosa islands .
wow .
% oh really .
okay .
so we have-
i saw it .
% um % hm , say go on .
talk a little bit .
% um and i like to-
if we go back to just now % uh sports , right ?
i wanted to actually show you % uh the another sport that you can do ,
% uh the other water sports that you can do out here
like cable skiing .
yes .
% oh i know that .
i tried that before in the philippines .
okay , and how about % uh something % uh-
wakeboarding , do you have that ?
wakeboarding , yes we have that as well .
yup .
i mean % um how much can i pay for that ?
okay , let me just % uh-
i guess-
okay , that would be the eastern part of singapore .
okay .
% uh it 's around thirty over dollars .
okay .
yah .
do you-
have you done that over in philippines ?
yes .
% um in camsur , there is wakeboarding competition there before .
% uh most of the surfer around the asian and some australian people go there
and compete .
okay .
as i have-
the-
of course the beach .
one of the coolest place in the southern part in singapore , right ?
% uh like eastern part , right ?
yes , we-
yes .
eastern part , we have the east coast and changi beach .
east .
changi beach .
% uh yes .
% uh but they are just simple beaches , you know .
nothing to worry .
yes .
and % uh then otherwise if you want % uh the nicer beach
that would be at the % uh sentosa or to take a boat to the southern islands .
yes then you get % uh the nicer % uh beach out there .
% ah okay .
% oh % um tell me about the % uh another thing is historical places .
okay .
% uh so i do n't have to rec~
do you want me to still recommend you some extreme sport here or we go straight
to the historical places ?
% uh no the sports first .
of course this % uh sport first .
sports first ?
okay now this one you are looking at is the % uh we have like the extreme swing .
% uh we also have the reverse bungee jump .
okay .
yah so and yes , i 'm scrolling down for you to see .
okay .
now , this is-
% uh i do n't know whether-
is it too small for you to see border x ?
% oh yah well that 's fine with me .
okay .
now this is indoor % uh rock climbing
and it 's right in the heart of % uh orchard .
okay .
the next sport will be % uh the cable ski and also wakeboarding ,
that 's in the east coast of singapore .
wow .
right .
next one extreme % uh swing
and this is something quite new is ifly .
so you are defying gravity .
i wan na try that one .
yah .
okay , this is on sentosa , alright .
so in the war-
% uh sky diving % uh stimulator .
% hm nice .
yah .
this is something interesting .
very interesting , alright .
okay , the price will be eighty nine dollars
% uh for an adult .
% oh eighty nine dollars .
not bad .
yah but it 's % uh-
well you ca n't get it in a lot of places , right ?
okay , so that 's the wakeboarding that you are talking about .
the next one-
and i think you may find % uh-
okay and we have also the extreme skate park
over here in the east coast .
and so that gives you a lot of % uh excitement , interesting things to do .
this is a free admission , huh .
but of course you are to bring your own skate .
they provide you only with the % uh hardware .
okay .
% oh i see the-
% oh i see .
do you-
yah , i try % uh-
i wan na try this one to the ultimate drive .
wow driving with different-
the-
using ferrari car .
yah , so you can-
% oh that one ?
% uh that one only comes in the % uh f1 .
% uh yah .
how much is that cost ?
okay .
now , this is a street circuit .
okay , it 's % uh two hundred and forty eight dollars .
i have one-
% oh by the way as-
the cost of this-
i mean using the ferrari car , how much it will cost ?
% uh sorry , what did you say ?
i mean how much i 'm gon na pay for using a-
% uh driving a ferrari car ?
% oh okay .
yah this is the prices over here .
% oh i se~
three hundred thirty nine ?
yah on your right-hand side , yes .
% oh % uh % uh .
% uh yah three ninety eight dol ~
sixty-minute will be % uh six hundred over dollars .
% uh thirty minutes , three hundred and ninety six .
and if you just do the street circuit that 's two hundred and forty eight doll ~
wow .
wow .
it 's too expensive for me .
okay .
yah just-
okay , i think the-
earlier on the % uh this ultimate skate park that is free .
% uh ifly , i think it 's still very reasonable
considering that it 's very really exciting to do that .
% um and i think borderx is still very affordable as well .
okay , so these are things that you may want to consider to do
% uh when you are in singapore .
so borderx it 's conveniently located ,
it 's in orchard road .
ski and % um the ski , cable ski , is on the east coast ,
so you could do that together with % uh sport of swimming in the east coast area or changi area .
now , % um ifly would be on sentosa island .
so , in case you 're going to sentosa island for a swim or to do the theme park ,
you could do that , % huh .
% uh wakeboarding it 's somewhere near the southern part of singapore ,
and % uh this one , yes you could combine again with sentosa , alright ?
now again the skate park , you could combine that with the % uh swim
over at the east coast area and the cable ski .
alright ?
because they are located in the same location .
okay so we % uh so you have lots and lots of things excitement to do
% um % uh for the extreme sport .
wow .
wow alright .
wow .
alright .
thanks for the info .
% um % uh okay let 's go to another hot tourist spot there .
% uh let me-
how about the historical places ?
can you give me some ?
okay .
% ah okay .
can you give me some-
right .
we have a few historical places % uh in singapore .
% um are you talking about ethnic historical places ?
yes .
okay of course % uh we have closer to % uh the orchard belt area
we have chinatown .
and aside chinese-
this is chinatown .
% oh i see .
okay .
i know pretty sure that there 's a lot of activities in chinatown , right ?
yes .
% uh more activities , you see a lot more in chinatown
% uh sometime during the january period .
% uh otherwise yes it 's a nice % uh % um a walk
along some of the different % uh % uh different % uh lanes of chinatown .
% uh it's-
so of course you see the traditional houses
that 's flashed on your screen now .
you can get % uh very typical chinese food % uh in chinatown .
so do try % uh one of our very local chicken rice , % um fried hokkien noodles , fried carrot cake ,
and of course something that you can bring home
would be the barbecue % uh meat slices .
and some of them comes in vacuum pack
and it 's very easy for you to bring home .
and so how much can i pay for that ?
% uh for the barbecue pork slices ?
yap .
okay , normal prices % uh excluding the chinese new year period ,
you can even get one piece % uh for fifty cents .
yes and it goes according to the weight .
% oh i se~
so it can % uh cost you like thirteen dollars or twelve dollars for one kilogram .
wow .
yah , so you can buy a few pieces which you just want it
or just to % uh for people to try one piece of
% uh barbecue pork slices would be a quarter of our % uh laptop slice .
yah .
% ah okay .
what else ?
okay , so that 's chinatown .
% uh we do have a very interesting museum called
the chinatown heritage centre .
% oh so what can i see there ?
okay .
now , % uh over in the chinatown heritage centre ,
you will see how people use to live in the past , alright .
i 'm just showing you some of their gallery pictures out here .
% ah okay .
okay , so you see how people used to live in the past because
% uh a lot of chinese , when they first came ,
a lot of them were illiterate
so they could not speak or write english
and neither not every one of the chinese could speak or write mandarin .
they would be speaking in their local dialect .
and since they were not skilled workers as well ,
they did n't have much money .
so they will just book or rent a bed space in all these chinatown houses .
so we can see how-
% uh what kind of living conditions they were living in % um in the
% uh chinatown heritage centre .
okay , so % uh this is the chinatown % uh heritage centre , yah .
just a few % uh gallery photos for you to see .
it 's located right in the heart of chinatown .
and it also nears in airport , right ?
okay .
orch~
yah orchard , yes .
it is pretty near because % uh singapore is not so big .
% uh so everywhere % uh that you are going travel
% uh approximately half an hour to one hour , it 's fine
% uh if you 're taking the public % uh transportation .
well good to hear that .
there is-
i do n't need to spend a lot of time travelling to different places there .
okay ?
yes .
yes .
so the admission charges is ten dollars for an adult
and six dollars for a child for a visit to the chinatown heritage centre .
so in chinatown you-
% uh do n't just walk around the % um lanes but
look into some of these % uh still traditional shops .
so they do have some interesting % uh things that they sell .
do also look out for % uh some chinese pastry shop
% uh that you do n't see them in the modern confectionery .
so very typical % uh chinese pastry .
% uh and something that 's very interesting would be a round kind of cake
called the mooncake .
% uh normally , yah .
okay .
i heard that moon cake .
i wan na try that too .
so-
yes , you can get that even if you come any time of the year .
okay , it 's % uh sweet .
% uh it 's a chinese pastry and of course we normally eat this food
during the mooncake festival .
and so when it will be happen again fo~
in this year ?
okay , at this year it will happen in the month of september .
% oh wow september .
% oh not bad .
yah , so this is the % uh mooncake festival .
and of course in this-
during this festival , a lot of the people-
okay i 'm gon na show the images of the mooncake festival .
okay , you can see this is mooncake .
alright ?
yah , % uh traditionally of course it should be brown
and inside the mooncake it is filled up with lotus paste .
but now % uh with the modern % um % uh influences ,
you can even have % uh all sorts of filling from % uh durian ,
% uh to egg custard , chocolate , blueberry mooncake , alright .
and of course during this festival at it 's % uh eg~
% uh together with this festival ,
we also carry or rather the children would carry the lanterns .
so you can see some of these lanterns here .
wo~
so how long it will take , i mean the festival ?
it will take a one week ?
the festival itself is just one day , yah .
so i think-
% oh one day festival , okay .
yes , it 's just for the one day festival .
but % uh prior to this festival ,
% uh people would be shopping % uh for mooncake to eat
during the mooncake festival .

as you can see from the houses here ,
they are a little bit different from the chinatown houses .
% uh there are carvings on the outside of the houses
but % um you wo n't see a live-
% uh creatures compared to the ones in chinatown .
yes you do see live creatures .
but the ones here would be mainly geometric
or % um a plants , % uh flowers kind of design
% uh on the facade of the building .
the highlight would be the southern mosque , okay .
and these are walking street in kampong glam .
is that not big ?
i mean it 's not big place , right ?

no , it 's % uh just a few street
% uh and you can walk .

it 's also accessible .
it 's pretty near to kampong glam actually .
so if you do n't mind taking a walk % uh about twenty minutes

i got no-
wow .
or even a malay dish call briyani % uh-

and you can have that meal % uh famous in store in little india .
okay , and you were talking about universal studio ?
right .
yup .
were you just mentioning about universal studio earlier on ?
yah , i just mention it because i have heard that
before that there is a universal studio in singapore .
yah , just so i just wan na know a little bit information on that .
maybe i could pass there and check it out .
okay .

yah .
i could check , i mean , i could pass and go there and check it .
okay .
okay , universal studio is a theme park .
it is % uh located in sentosa .
okay .
now , you can see this % uh rollercoaster ?
very exciting .
% ah i see .
wow .
and some pictures of what you will see in universal studio .
okay .
% oh i mean-
and of course you see there are seven areas of universal studio .
okay i need ro reduce for only-
for one day ?
do you think ?
reduce one day ?
yah .
do you think ?
sorry ?
do you think i can-
you just want to spend one day in singapore ?
% uh no , i mean do you think i can tour this universal studio
for only-
for one day ?
yes , you can .
you can finish all the rides in one day
% uh for universal studio .
% oh i see .
i-
i thought i can not finish it .
can .
possible .
it 's possible to finish it up all the rides in one day .
% oh i see .
% oh good .
because that park will be open
% uh from ten a.m . to nine p.m . so no problem .
you can finish all the rides .
wow .
yah .
% uh how much , i mean
how much the entrance there if i go to-
the admission ?
% um % hm , the admission .
to the universal studio ?
yup .
okay for % uh adult it 's sixty eight dollars % uh for % uh not-
% uh weekday .
weekend will be seventy four dollars .
and the child will be fifty dollars and % um weekends would be fifty four dollars .
% hm good .
so if you 're thinking of doing the universal studio
and since earlier on you indicated that you also like to try the ifly ,
% uh the ifly is on sentosa island .
% oh so i could drop by this too after i go to-
yes , so you could do these two activities % uh in one day .
yah great , good .
% um what else ? % um .
% um what else ? % um .
beach , mountain , universal studio , ethical places % um may-
okay .
beach .
yup .
% uh beach .
% uh just now yes you also mentioned about beaches .
yup .
% uh we do have % uh i would say % uh better beaches
out on sentosa island .
so you could easily spent two days ,
come back again the next day and do your beaches , the beach
on sentosa island .
alright .
okay .
% oh good .
aside from the of course the theme park ,
do you have any % hm how 'd you call it ?
% um what you call it by the way ?
theme park % uh-
% uh no .
other than theme park ?
food .
yah yes i mean delicacies food .
yah , i forgot it .
% oh whether there is food available in the theme park ?
what % uh-
no , i mean can you give me some example
of a delicacies of the singaporean people ?
i just wan na know about it .
do you have any idea ?
yah of course , hold on .
okay , delicacy .
chilli crab .
% oh chilli crab .
so usually , i mean , all the tourists there
% um eat chilli pot ?
well , if for people who do n't mi~
% uh who like spicy food ,
because chilli crab is definitely spicy , okay .
so these are % uh chilli crabs , different recipes of chilli crab .
and % uh this is something that a lot of the locals like to eat .
so , yes i would say chilli crab will be something % hm very unique to singapore
or the other version would be pepper crab .
% uh chili crab , okay .
pepper crab , okay .
so i can buy any-
i ca~
i just % uh i can buy res~
can buy it in any restaurant there , right ?
yes , most of the seafood restaurant would be able to cook for you
% uh pepper crab or % um % uh chili crabs .
chilli crab .
^um % hm .
but it 's not that expensive too ?
yah .
right ?
it 's not that expensive .
they normally % uh the price will be charged according
to the size and the weight , the weight of the crabs .
so while before you even order ,
% uh ask the % uh restaurant to give you the pricing first .
so generally one crab
% uh a medium size crab would cost you about % um twenty dollars .
so if you have % uh just two of you ,
one crab is enough .
% oh i see that big one .
i do n't know if i could-
yah .
yah , these are-
yes it not that tiny .
so yes you do get a fair bit of flesh .
% uh so yes the restaurant will tell you .
first you tell them , you know , to let you know the price first ,
% uh like how much roughly it 's going cost you
if you order one , you order two because it 's quite hard to tell you
the exact price because the price are priced according to weight of the crab
for seafood .
so they price it accordingly .
wow .
this is % uh pepper crab .
again different % uh recipes of % uh pepper crab out here .
okay , so this is % uh something a lot of people like to eat .
% uh i believe you got durians in philippines ?
yup we do have .
do you like durian ?
yah , okay .
so this-
yes , we do like durians out here .
% uh okay , so now another kind of food that you may like to consider
would be a-
% hm what else ?
okay .
so this is another food % uh that you may like to eat .
okay , this is oyster omelette .
is-
it-
oops !
wow .
you are hungry now , right ?
i 'm going to show you so many images of food .
yes , i 'm hungry now .
yes .
yah .
it 's % uh egg % uh cooked with-
or rather oyster cooked with egg .
so it 's actually % uh oyster omelette .
wow .
again you can eat them from % uh major-
i mean from most of our food centre ,
air-condition , non air-condition
or even restaurants , chinese restaurant they offer this
% um % uh to % uh the guest .
wow i wan na taste that .
i wan na eat that .
yes .
yah so we have a lot of option in terms of food , huh .
so if you want to try all the food in singapore
you probably have to stay a few years here .
yes , % uh definitely you 're correct about that .
% hm what else ?
% um what else ?
can you give me some more exciting places ?
and i wan na do every adventure there when i-
while i 'm gon na stay there .
okay , so we have % uh covered all the % uh sport % uh earlier on , right ?
okay , % um do you want to do a bit of kite flying over in singapore ?
% oh sure .
definitely i love to do that .
okay we can do because the wind there is very good
and a lot of % uh people do kite flying out there .
% uh some of them do this mechanical kite flying over at the % uh marina barrage .
wow that is the first time that i heard
mechanical fly kite .
right .
yes .
yah , that is the first time that i heard that .
okay , so this is the place .
yes you can see all these kites out there .
okay yes they are driving kites .
and % uh well they are mechanical-
some of them are mechanical % uh operated kind of kites .
it 's not the traditional % uh kite .
% oh i see .
so this is done at the marina barrage .
% oh i see .
% oh what 's that parachute by the way ?
what you call that ?
% oh why do we go there to fly kites ?
okay , because % uh you get a very good sc~
% uh view , you can see the landmarks behind .
% uh these are the financial district of singapore and here
you can see a little bit of the water here .
this is at the marina bay .
and the wind is usually very strong out there ,
so at any time of the day , you see people flying kites out there .
wow .
okay what you need to do is if you do n't have kites ,
you can buy it over there or you can bring your own kites there
and fly your kite .
okay , so this is the kite flying % uh over at the marina barrage .
wow great .
there you can see lots of people flying kites out there .
okay , so anytime % uh of % uh the day , alright ?
% hm alright .
now , you see these three towers here ?
this is the marina bay sands resort .
if you just like to have a little bit % uh try your luck , i guess .
you can go into the casino .
% uh that 's located in the basement of the marina bay sands resort .
i see .
okay , if you want to have a good view
of the southern part of singapore as well as the south china sea ,
you can a take ride up to the cantilever .
% uh on top of the marina bay sands resort , incurred a very good view up there .
% uh do i have to pay the entrance for that or ?
yes , that will cost you twenty dollars .
up to go up there .
okay and there is a very good % uh dance club up there as well it 's world famous .
it 's a famous % uh club .
wow .
the night-
which means the nightlife is there is pretty real live .
you have-
that 's right .
or if you do n't want , you can just go there and just have a good view
% um % uh of % uh a very good view .
three hundred sixty five view of % uh singapore .
wow .
i wan na try that too .
yah well there 's a lot of things you wan na do that you can do , yah
in singapore .
okay , so this is the kite flying over at the marina bay .
you can see there a big kites out there .
okay big-
yah .
i guess i gon na do that for one to two days .
i guess i need to go back every month ,
just to-
yes , every month you will have to come for two days .
or you can also make it a longer trip .
% uh is to tour
yes .
but i ca n't do % uh well
i always busy by weekdays , only by weekends i can only drop by in singapore .
% oh okay .
yah .
so , yah .
so these are some of all the-
will you be interested in war museums ?
% oh yes .
well it 's always on around the city , right ?
so i ca~
% uh we have a quite few war museums
all over % uh various parts of singapore .
and-
but-
but if it-
but it will not take a long for i mean two to three hours ' drive ?
% uh no , yes .
% uh like i mention , everywhere you go in singapore will probably take you only % uh
half an hour to one hour if you are taking the public transport .
no ?
% oh % uh good to hear that .
% uh at least i can do a lot of things within less than an hour .
huh .
yes , and % uh some of the museums are not that big .
you probably can spend one hour , if you do n't have much time ,
% uh two hours would be most ideal for most of our museum .
so % uh there are war museums % um-
if you are doing sentosa , you can come by this museum together because
% uh it is just about two bus stop
and you have to just walk up a hill call ' kit chandu .
so what do you call that museum ?
% uh it 's called bukit chandu .
reflections at bukit chandu .
% oh bukit chandu .
okay .
thanks .
% uh so how much the entrance for that ?
okay , just give me a minute .
okay , i 'm sorry .
you said before that there are three museum -
sorry .
you said before that there are three museum that i can go , right ?
three museum ?
yup .
or there are some few museum that i can check ?
yes , there are few museums you can check .
so % uh i 'm giving you in terms of location .
so let say if you are doing the ifly , the % um universal studio on sentosa island
then you could do this museum because
they are in the % uh southern part of singapore .
% uh , you know , because you also mention that you do n't want to
spend too much time travelling .
so they are in like basically the same location ,
so you could this museum .
it 's a good museum and there is a show inside the museum .
% uh but basically this museum % uh shows you % uh the last battle of singapore
at the southern part of singapore .
and % uh last % uh-
that area is the defended by the % uh malay regiment of singapore .
so that was a very fierce battle that was fought
in the southern part of singapore .
so at this particular building ,
% um % uh and around the hill area ,
that was the last battle just before singapore surrender .
are-
% uh universal studio % um % hm .
% hm % uh yap .
alright .
great .
so , yes .
again if you are going to sentosa ,
we have another museum there .
% uh it 's called fort siloso .
fort siloso .
fort siloso .
it also the around in sentosa .
yah , walking-
yes , it 's on sentosa .
so again , you know , you easily can spend a number of days
just on sentosa .
so i 'm going to show you some images of fort siloso .
% uh this one will be the wax % uh figure
showing you the surrender of singa~
% uh of the japanese to the allied forces in nineteen forty five .
and this one here will be the surrender of the british to the japanese in nineteen forty three , alright ?
so it shows you the war % um that happened
% uh on in sentosa , alright .
% uh so how much the entrance for that ?
how much do i cost if i-
okay % uh-
okay , this one the entrance is ten dollar .
% oh ten dollars .
% hm okay .
yah .
and the-
you show that the other museum that you said ,
how much the entrance for that ?
% uh that is also ten dollars .
% ah the same .
yes .
okay , but again it depends on what you want to see .
if you just want to see the last battle ,
or do you want to see like more of the % uh artefacts that were used % uh-
alright , there 's one here .
this is on % uh fort siloso .
okay .
yes , so i 'm just showing you images of the fort siloso .
this museum it 's % uh some parts of it are open air .
% uh whereas the other one would be a indoor kind of a museum .
wow .
so we are talking about different % uh focus of war
% uh for this % uh two museum .
and of course there are lot more other museums .
so i just % uh recommend you this two % uh for the time being .
yes .
% hm what else ?
so you have been doing a lot of % uh-
well i have recommended you a lot of exciting things to do .
do you want to tone down things a little bit ?
yah sure .
actually i like to try to organise my tour when i-
so when i go there at least i could go or
i mean i could tour a lot of places in-
maybe a few days .
% uh expent in sen-
inspect in sentosa ,
well i guess i could go to into two different museum ,
also the beach and the on~
i % uh what you call that ?
the i ?
right .
ifly ?
yah the ifly and the universal studio .
well i guess i can do that for i guess two to three days , right ?
yah .
% uh yes , you could do all these yes in two to three days .
% um because besides the attraction that we talk about ,
there are other attractions like the other parks % uh images
% uh there 's a museum also , another museum showcasing the history of singapore .
% uh so again , yes easily two to three days .
so like i said you just have to shortlist , you know .

i mean it 's an hour ?
% uh just an half an hour ride .

yes .
% uh that i gues i will gon na buy some one bottle of beer
and that 's it .
no need to buy
a lot of beers then .
% oh dear .

just to tone down things a little bit .
% uh you can just take a river cruise .
% uh that would cost you fifteen dollars ,
along the % uh , okay , along the singapore river .
okay .
oops !

% uh yes , the price is the same but of course we are looking at
% uh different scenery .
okay , you are just looking at different scenery .
% uh in the night time ,
% uh you get to see the lights and there 's a commentary on the cruise itself .
% uh like i said , you know , since you are going to do so much exciting things in singapore
so we just tone down things a little bit .
if you still have the time % uh and energy ,
then you just go for a river cruise on the singapore river .
yes , definitely .
okay .
okay , yes .
what else ?
okay , you 'll be seeing this % uh and this is the boat .
let me show you the boat .
yah , % uh it 's used to ferry goods in the past ,
% uh this kind of boat .
wow .
alright .
i do n't know whether you see this boat out there ?
and the buildings behind is actually is boat quay .
so if you are taking in the daytime , this cruise ,
then of course it 's a totally different kind of scenery .
the night cruise when all the lights comes on
and again a different view of % uh singapore on the river itself .
huh ?
wow .
i guess that 's it .
okay ?
you give me a lot of information that it helps me a lot .
yah , so you have to come back a few times % huh , not just one , okay .
yes % uh not just one time .

hopefully .
thank you so much .
have a great day .
bye .
alright .
welco~
okay , same to you .
bye .
hello ?
hi % um this is participant number twenty five ,
my name is arlyn .
could you spell your name again please ?
% um it 's a r l y n .
% oh arlyn , i see .
i am tour guide number two and my name is jeanne .
good morning arlyn .
hi jeanne .
hi arlyn .
how can i help you ?
% um well you see my husband and i will be celebrating our wedding anniversary coming may
and we 're sort of thinking % um going on a tour in asia maybe .
% uh can i have your dates again please ?
% um some time this may .
okay in may .
and-
so the dates are flexible
you are not % uh-
you have n't book anything yet ?
no , not yet .
what are your interests ?
% um well % um one of the places that we 'd really like to go to for this tour
will probably be singapore .
i have heard a lot of good things about it and maybe that 's a very good place to start .
yes singapore is a hub for the rest of southeast asia
% uh we have also very good connections by air and by sea .
but what particularly are-
is your husband and you-
% uh what do you normally do when you 're relaxing ?
alright .
so for this particular tour since we 're gon na probably bring along our daughter with us
we 're sort of thinking % um probably going to a theme park maybe .
a theme park , okay .
how old is your daughter ?
% um she 's four .
% oh she 's only four years old , okay .
yah .
% uh but at four years old % uh-
some of the rides she may not be able to take .
you can visit the theme parks but % uh like the roller coaster rides and all that
they may have restrictions on % uh on the height or the age of children for some of the rides
because of her size .
% uh % hm , i totally understand .
will there be anything else that you would probably recommend aside from that ?
you can bring her to the gardens
% uh you can bring her to the zoo
and also the bird park
and the night safari .
% oh i am very interested about the night safari ,
can you tell more about that please ?
% uh night safari .
can i % uh show you about the % uh singapore wildlife reserves that runs all three parks ?
% oh please do .
just give me a moment .
okay .
so what you 're seeing is an aviary
where the birds fly free within the jurong bird park .
and this the night safari tram ride
which you can take % uh if you are too tired to walk
or you can walk as well as you know take the ride .
you can do both if you have time .
okay .
so what time does the night safari usually open ?
if-
% uh you can go in a little bit earlier but they wo n't let you ride inside
to take the tram ride until after the sun goes down which is seven o'clock .
% uh those are tapirs that you see along the ride .
now this is the day zoo
can you see elephants of asia ?
yup , i surely can .
so this is one of the shows that you see at the zoo
which is next to the night safari .
so you should visit .
% uh if she likes the zoo very much
because they have a children 's % uh playground area in there
and she can take a little % uh like a train around the zoo % uh in the children 's playground .
she can also % uh see-
you know pet the little animals ,
the small ones that are like rabbits and % uh pygmy horses , you know .
the very small and tame animals
she can % uh do rides and she can handle them
and the shows are directed at children .
right .
so that sounds really interesting .
i 'm pretty sure my daughter is gon na love that
because she loves animals really .
% um will there be like activities
% um like feeding the animals or riding the small animals maybe ?
yes , there are % uh times where you can ride the elephants ,
or the horses in the zoo .
% uh at night we have a tribal show % uh at the night safari
where they recreate what the tribes do in borneo .
% oh , that sounds interesting .
so % um what i 'm seeing right now these are different places , right ?
the bird park , the night safari , river safari and the singapore zoo
these are all different places , am i correct ?
yes that 's right , they-
because they are run under one organisation known as wildlife reserves .
so it is one-
under one umbrella organisation
and that means you can buy a package ticket with a built-in discount .
and-
okay .
% um for all of them ?
yes for all of them .
normally you have a month to use up the ticket but-
so if you 're staying just two or three days you would definitely use it up .
wow .
% um can you tell me more about % um the river safari ?
okay , river safari is new .
and it takes you from one part of the zoo
to another part
and you 're lucky because it has just opened .
so of course you 're not going to go to all those rivers that was shown just now
but it 's a simulation .
% um , okay .
so here you go you can see % uh crocodiles -
baby crocodile here .
so what other activities do you have % um in the river safari ?
will there be boat rides available ?
yes you take the boat and you can see the exhibits
and on the boat ride the guide will show you % um you know the skin
the moult of the % uh snakes .
things that you do n't normally see when you % uh just visit a zoo
but when you take the ride you can see exhibits that they have collected .
you know when the animals die they have these specimens .
% oh i see .
that sounds really nice .
i'm-
now the panda that you just saw
they have not yet come .
% uh okay .
but they are coming , okay
so we are just % uh waiting for them arrive .
so this is just opened last january ?
yes this % uh night-
% uh the river safari is % uh a new trail .
they had a river ride all along but now they have enhanced it .
% oh i see .
so you see at the bottom there the different zones ?
so they are trying to re-create these zones within the river safari .
it seems to me as if this is gon na be a very big place .
% uh yes it is .
% uh it 's % uh forty hectares if i remember correctly , the riv~
the whole zoo .
% oh my goodness .
yah .
% uh they actually have ninety hectares in total
but they have n't develop the whole area .
so % uh the night safari % uh-
shall i show you pictures of that ?
% oh , yes please .
night safari gives you % uh very magical feel
because here we have nocturnal animals
and also some animals that are both nocturnal and diurnal .
so we have settle lighting % uh at where they feed
and then they will put food at these places .
it 's actually token feeding .
it 's to encourage the animals to be in the light so you can see .
and some like these tapirs they are tame enough
for them to roam around along the trails .
so sometimes they stop and % uh % uh let-
they have to stop to let the tapirs have right of way .
well i can just imagine that , right .
% um well definitely i 'd like to see % um any of these places that you 've just shown me
'cause like i said my kid just loves animals
so this is probably something i have to put on my agenda when i go to singapore .
you can take photos in the zoo and the bird park
but not at the night safari % uh at the animals .
you can take when they are doing the show
you can take cozying in the open areas but not at the animals
because we won't-
do n't want to spook them .
yah .
that 's the only thing .
right .
% uh would you know how much this is gon na cost
to have a package ticket for all of these places that you 've just shown me ?
okay .
% uh do you want to see the zoo ?
did i show you the zoo ?
i show you the zoo first and then i give you the package ticket , okay ?
okay .
that will work .
that 's the naked mole rat
that 's why they called it the nudist colony .
you 're not going to-
make sense .
you wo n't see naked people there
do n't worry .
okay .
and here you see .
if you go early enough you can breakfast with wildlife .
are you getting it on your screen ?
yes , i definitely am .
the three animals at the back that look like hairy monkeys
they are orang-utans .
that you normally have to go into the forest to see
% uh but here some of them are actually bred in our zoo
and they are trained so they come out
and you can take a photograph with them even your daughter .
that would make a good souvenir photograph , yah .
yah , definitely .
and we have-
but they do n't like-
% um these orang-utans that you 've shown me here
they do n't like % um grab the food on your plate when you 're having breakfast , do they ?
% uh no
because % uh where you 're eating is separate from where they are
and they have a buffet of fruits that they are eating .
so they do n't come and help themselves to your food .
you can also go to the fragile forest which is an open area
and you 're looking at i think some lemurs at the back
there will be butterflies fluttering , birds flying around
it 's an open area to show you the ecosystem in a forest .
% uh so the specimens inside or rather the exhibits inside there
are all tamed and quite friendly .
that 's nice .
including the two-toed sloth .
you know the very slow moving sloth
that % uh it 's up the tree .
it 's very hard to see in the jungle , you can see it here .
yup .
yup .
% hm , i see .
and we have the sea lions that do a show ,
you can get your daughter to take part in the show .
are you there ?
yup i 'm definitely there .
i 'm looking at the pictures and i am thinking of the activities that
you know we 'd probably do when we get there .
yah .
you can volunteer % uh your daughter
when they asked for volunteers at the bird park show
and also at the % uh day zoo tour
and if they selected then she 'll be the star of the show .
i 'll probably take a video of her .
yes , that would be fun is n't it ?
% oh yes .
especially yes , having your wedding anniversary .
so shall i show you-
you were asking about ticketing , right ?
yup .
yes ma'am .
% uh , % oh just hold on a minute .
% oh i think it's-
wait .
okay .
can you see the park hoppers ' specials ?
yup .
so three in one
because if you go to all three parks you are paying only fifty eight dollars .
alright .
and if you visit just the night safari and zoo it 's forty eight .
there is a saving
because the individual tickets are costed at a higher price .
alright , i got that .
and you see you can use it within a month ,
within thirty days .
s~
the only thing is it doesn't-
% uh % oh it includes the night safari tram ride
but % uh not the tram ride within the day zoo .
so if you want to take a tram within the singapore zoo in the day time
you have to pay about five dollars or so for the tram ride .
alright , got that .
you can also walk % uh after you do your tram ride if you have time
because then you can see % uh on the night safari different set of animals
and the day zoo she can get closer up to all the animals .
% uh % hm , okay .
so i was about to ask you a question
but i 'm actually reading the answer from what you 're showing me .
so it says there that visits to the three park need not be in one day
so i got my answer just right there .
yah .
yes , that 's right you see
thirty days to use it up .
so you could even take one at a time .
right .
but if you go to the night safari and the zoo % uh at the same time
because they are next to each other
you save on the fare and the time ,
you save time travelling .
you can visit the zoo starting from morning 'till evening
or you can visit it in the afternoon 'till about six o'clock
and then just walk across to the night safari .
i see .
okay .
okay .
% uh do you want to see pictures of the tram ride ?
% um , i think i 'm good .
you 're okay % huh .
yup .
alright .
i 'm okay with the zoo .
what about % um cultural shows ?
you have like cultural shows there ?
cultural shows % uh-
we have activities-
if you 're thinking of your daughter
we have activities within our museums targeted at children .
% uh but % uh culturals shows , no
we have more the adult theme shows .
okay .
can you show me that too ?
okay .
you 're talking about normal cultural shows
% uh nothing to do with the zoo , right ?
right .
might as well experience the culture right
and see how different it is from where i come from .
okay .
% uh what i 'm showing you is actually a show that just shown % uh in a resort .
but if you are talking about chinese , malay , indian dance
we used to include it on a city tour
but % uh it 's not really % uh a show that you just go on and see you know
% um like in many other places .
okay .
okay .
but when you 're here , if there are shows at our esplanade which i will show you later
you might want to book them .
just give me a minute to get you the resort , the sentosa resort .
% uh the mar~
we have a re~
big resort on sentosa island .
okay .
what you can see-
i do n't call it cultural actually
it 's % uh got % uh pyrotechnics .
so if you like the beach and you go to sentosa
you can see this show .
so it 's not the traditional cultural show
you know what i mean ?
yup .
but your daughter might enjoy this
it 's % uh full of colour , you can see there .
and there 's probably music there too % huh ?
yes music .
% uh before that % uh the people will be encouraging you to sing along with them .
so this is more high-tech
it 's what i think people like today .
so you go there in the evening ,
can you see the times here at seven-
% um yup , seven forty .
and eight forty .
and because it 's popular
they have an additional show on saturdays and public holidays
usually there 's an additional show .
ei~
yup .
i see .
i might check that out too .
yes .
% uh if you go to sentosa island you go to the beach
this is just % uh along the beach .
% um i see .
so what 's the difference between your premium seats and your standard seats ?
% uh i think premium seats are more in the centre and
let me scroll down i think these are premium seats .
perhaps padded , there you are .
so you pay for the cushioning
and you get a very good view .
well i might just you know sign up for a
what you call that , a standard seat
and then bring my own cushion or something .
but i think here you 'll get a better view .
you are right in the centre so that you can see it very well .
alright .
% uh there 's another show
and it 's called the voyage de la vie
it is at the sentosa resorts .
can you show that to me as well ?
yes , just a moment .
so i know i 'm not answering your question directly about cultural shows
% oh no , that 's fine .
you 're doing a great job jeanne , do n't worry .
these are more fun things that % uh singaporeans also go to enjoy .
and i have seen this show myself .
% uh there 's a lot of acrobatics ,
% uh very spectacular .
% uh the cast is international .
well like i said well i really want to see it would be something that , you know
not the every day thing that we usually see here .
yah .
so there you see it 's % uh our longest running show .
% hm , so how long has it been running there ?
% oh i ca n't remember exactly .
i do n't know if this they tell it here
but i saw it months ago , it 's ninety minutes .
it 's a circus % uh theatre production and-
% oh i did n't even know it 's created in singapore
through a celebration of song and dance .
it 's full of activity
so one and a half of hours .
the story is simple about a young man on a journey
but it is more-
you see the dancing , you see the acrobatics .
and this happens like every day ?
yes every day % uh i think .
% uh let me see , they must have a day off probably .
okay .
they are taking from wednesday to friday
from october the first , yes .
so that means i think monday and tuesday is their day off .
alright .
okay .
i-
for sure the acrobats they need a break
so wednesday and friday at eight thirty
but saturday and sunday they have a matinee show .
% uh because it 's so popular they want to have a earlier show
so some people take the show and then they % uh do the songs of the sea after that .
that 's nice .
and i think-
i think it 's their annually from twelve to twenty third of september .
yah .
their break-
their vacation maybe .
okay .
% hm i 'm looking at the prices .
so hundred eighty eight is probably the nearest seat to the stage , right ?
yah .
frankly you do n't need to have the hundred and eighty eight dollar tickets .
% uh i think hundred and eight is good enough already .
and that 's the same fee for let say
or do they admit kids like my daughter 's age ?
they-
yes i think they do , let me see .
they do n't have child rates though .
so kids have to pay the same rate as adults .
alright .
okay .
the theatre is n't very large ,
i do n't know the actual capacity
but i was inside and i think it 's not like so huge
that if you pay hundred and eight dollars you ca n't see very well .
some people do n't have the performers right you know too near them ,
it could be scary .
so % uh hundred and eight dollars would be fine .
okay , i got that .
% hm , i think i 'm gon na have my agenda full .
yes .
what about shops ?
can you recommend shops maybe that you have ?
% uh high-end shops we have down at orchard road
which is the main tourist belt with the more expensive hotels or the better class hotels .
% uh then we have also shopping malls
% uh just in front of sentosa there is vivocity and harbourfront .
vivocity is newer
and it has got % uh a very huge singaporean following on % uh weekends .
i 'm showing you orchard road on the screen first .
okay .
so you can see we 've got gucci there .
it's-
you can get all the good brands there
but there are also shops that sell things like g two thousand
do you know it ?
yup .
a mid-price range .
but the concentration of branded shops would be at orchard road
and also at marina bay sands where that we have a casino .
so what sort of shopping are you looking for ?
% um nothing in particular maybe .
% um i was thinking of just , you know % um checking the shops out and see-
you know what could probably be in~
of interest for me and my husband or my kid .
okay if-
since you 're celebrating your wedding anniversary
your husband might want to buy you , you know something very grand .
do you see this picture here ?
i hope you get to talk with my husband .
% uh so this is marina bay sands
it 's the other resort in singapore and it 's down by the bay .
it 's not very far from sentosa in fact .
can you see the building ?
yup , it looks very nice .
so right on top is the swimming pool
but % uh-
right on top of it ?
yes .
is that an infinity pool ?
yes .
% uh actually infinity pools scare me a little bit
i think i 'm going to swim right out to see .
well do n't go near the edge then .
stay away from it .
okay , we have here-
% uh let me go to the shopping alright .
we have a list of shops here .
% oh you have to search for the store ,
let me see .
so what 's your favourite shop , jeanne ?
% um i 'd like to go to an old store that has kept up with the times and modernised
and it 's called c k tang .
tangs is the short form , t a n g
and it 's at vivocity just in front of sentosa island .
% uh here you see-
this is a list of the shops you get at marina bay sands
% uh or rather it 's categorised by what you want .
so what is your preference , i can select for you .
% um what about jewellery ?
jewellery .
okay these are the stores we have ,
bulgari % uh cartier
all the branded % uh-
have you checked up some of them ?
% uh from the store window .
citigems is-
i think it 's local , tio tianpo also .
so you should be able to get prices that are not so % um high-end over there .
so can you see citigems on your screen ?
% uh % hm , i can .
so this is a huge shopping area called the shoppes at marina bay sands ,
can you see on the right hand side of your screen ?
so this if you want to spare your husband you go to citigems .
if you want to break his bank you go to some of the other store .
the cartier or something .
yes .
% uh anything else you want to see by way of shops ?
% um i think i 'm good .
% um maybe we can talk about the hotel next .
okay .
you have n't selected your hotel % huh , have you ?
% uh no not yet .
% i 'm really just at the planning stage right now .
okay , but % uh-
i will-
we have got marina bay sands still on the screen
so we 'll have to wait for it first and then we search for your hotel .
% ah okay .
'cause i would rather have as much information as i can at this point
before we finally decide .
okay .
i want to suggest to you this hotel in chinatown .
it is quite romantic .
it is a boutique hotel -
oops .
you see the building was built in nineteen twenty nine hence the name of the hotel
but it was bought over by a young man who likes to % uh restore old buildings .
and so it 's a protected building and it 's been converted into hotel rooms .
okay .
and here you see the facade of the hotel .
it 's got bay windows .
the rooms are very interesting
% uh that he even has a suite on the % uh top floor .
so you do n't have dates
you 're just talking about may is it ?
% uh % hm , may .
right , may .
okay .
may .
will there be available rooms ?
% uh we can check ,
shall we start ?
what day in may are you thinking of ?
% um probably not a weekend
% uh maybe midweek or something .
not a-
okay .
what about wednesday maybe ?
wednesday the ninth ?
because may day would be on the first .
% uh if they have higher rates on that ti~
at that time they might be charging a bit more .
% oh really ?
yah .
room ,
so are you taking one room or two rooms ?
% um one room .
one room is enough , % huh ?
yup .
% uh one room .
because your daughter is only four
or we can put it as two guests
but you can ask for an extra bed when you are there .
yah .
but this hotel is safe , right ?
i mean-
% oh it 's very safe .
it 's in the heart of chinatown .
being a-
being a very old hotel
it 's not gon na crumble down on me is it ?
% oh no it's-
% uh you saw the picture ,
it 's been totally refurbished .
yup .
okay .
and totally renovated .
and i have in fact visited it when % uh it was % uh completed
and they have % uh even a room
where you can have % uh a bath looking out into the sky .
% hm , that 's interesting .
% uh i did-
we did step into the bathroom and check out
because you know around there are skyscrapers all the hotel % uh buildings and % uh office buildings
but they have a lot of greenery around
and so that it shades off-
it shades you off from the view of anybody nearby .
superior room is called the terrace suite ,
can you see the price ?
that 's the one with the bathroom that you were talking about earlier .
yes .
yes .
it 's quite fun actually if you are not the shy type .
but unfortunately i am .
you are ?
it is % uh quite okay
you should actually check it out and have a look .
it 's just that you know % uh this is quite nice
because it 's right at the top of the hotel ,
the hotel has just about three storeys .
% uh you can also take % uh junior suite then .
do you have pictures of that ?
okay .
yes .
here we go .
junior suite ,
i 'm trying to get a picture of it for you .
so junior suite ,
that was the next category to the terrace .
so can you see everything is new in there ?
it 's really nice jeanne
it 's just that i think with the price of the junior suite
i might not have enough money to go to the places that i want to go to .
% uh you should have enough .
% uh what was the price of % uh your show
it 's a hundred and eight dollars , right ?
% um % hm . that 's for one person , right ?
but the-
yes % uh .
so in fact you have-
we have tickets at forty eight dollars if i remember correctly .
% uh the junior suite is two hundred plus
like two hundred and fourteen dollars .
that 's for one day ?
yah .
so you stay in two days , is that right ?
right .
so that 's gon na be around four hundred already plus , you know the add-ons .
seven hundred over dollars , yah .
so-
you have to go down on your % uh expectations for the show .
you need to downgrade on your show .
or maybe downgrade on the room .
what about the other rooms ,
can we check those out as well ?
okay .
this room is a hundred and ninety six dollars
deluxe room .
okay , that will do .
yes that would be under two hundred dollars .
how is it different from what 's that , superior double ?
% uh superior double ,
maybe the fittings i 'm not sure .
you want to see superior double ?
yah , let 's take a look .
yes it 's the fittings ,
it 's a little bit simpler .
i think the deluxe room is a lot better
do n't you think ?
yes ,
% uh very nice , very pretty .
and you may notice that deluxe and the suites have the same decor .
right .
and you have your own wash basin right next to you .
okay .
so-
maybe you downgrade on your show price tickets .
so your rooms % uh-
so maybe % uh-
i 'll maybe go for the deluxe room then
and we 'll definitely go to the % um zoo for my kid .
the zoo price was about sixty dollars , right ?
% uh somewhere around that ,
just a minute .
right .
okay .
do you want to see the sup~
you do n't want the superior double , % huh ?
% um well do you have other pictures ?
because from the picture that i looked at earlier % um-
okay .
no .
s~
okay that 's the only picture we have of the room .
yah .
so we close this .
so this is the room you want ?
yup .
yes it 's two hundred and fourteen dollars so four hundred and twenty eight dollars .
% uh do you want to see the show at forty eight dollars or fifty eight dollars ?
% um maybe i 'll put the safari thing on top of my list
for my daughter 's sake .
safari price was about sixty -
let me see i forget the price .
package price for the three in one
for the night safari zoo and the bird park , right .
the wildlife reserves .
'cause i was always-
also thinking that two days might not be enough to you know to cover everything .
if you are staying two whole nights ,
one night for the night safari and one night for the show .
so let 's see the rates .
% uh the package price is what you want , right ?
okay .
so yah , it 's about sixty dollars .
it 's fifty eight dollars for the three of you .
% uh for one of you .
so let 's take it at sixty so it 's about a hundred and eighty dollars for your-
% hm but % uh-
but i see that the price for the kid is % uh different
it 's only thirty eight dollars .
% oh yes .
thirty eight dollars so it 's only a hundred and sixty dollars .
so you have spent % uh four hundred -
almost five hundred dollars .
so i think i have money for the show then .
yes , % uh-
but not on a hundred and eight
because you want to eat right ?
you want to
unless you have a separate budget for that .
of course .
% uh can you downgrade to the fifty eight dollar ticket for the show ?
would n't that be too far or do you think that 's just right ?
no it 's not too far
because as i said the hall is n't very big
and the performers are right in front of you , you know .
it is % uh-
you get a good view .
okay .
then how much is that again fifty eight dollars ?
yah fifty eight dollars is one of the lower price range
well take it at a hundred and eighty dollars for the three of you .
of course there 's no child ticket .
so you have seven hundred and sixty eight dollars spent more or less now .
so what about you know the ride from the hotel
going to the zoo and the show ?
% hm it will not % uh break the bank .
% uh maybe you shall pay % uh twenty dollars or twenty five dollars for the ticket ,
% uh it 's called the ez-link card for-
you know when you travel by train and by bus .
you use this card to pay for your fare so you do n't have to use any money .
so you just buy that card and then you use it for your bus and train rides , correct ?
that 's right .
and then before you leave any balance value you can get a refund .
so how much do these ez cards cost ?
% uh at the airport you pay twelve dollars .
here you go , can you see ?
and-
% oh there you go .
yah .
and you would have to top up some money so-
or maybe you allow thirty dollars for it just to be safe .
so you do n't have-
thirty dollars for one person ?
yes .
so you do n't have to go to a seven eleven store
to top up the value if you run out .
% hm i see .
then you 'll get your change before you leave your airport
you go to the counter and get a refund .
so the thirty dollar value that-
do you think that will be enough for the entire duration for the trip
or % um how much just one person usually spend going around .
% uh it depends on how far you are going and the places you 're going to
except for the zoo and % uh bird park is the further .
it 's just a little over two dollars for the both of you .
% uh two dollars each , yah .
so % um-
so i need to get two of those , correct ?
you need to get three % uh-
you need to get three % uh to to use for your daughter as well
and then you get your refund before you leave .
so i have provided like ninety dollars for the three of you
and you know you have some extra spare .
% ah alright .
okay .
right .
% um any you know % um food places that you 'd probably recommend ,
we can check out before we go-
that brings you to-
food places .
yup .
anything particular you have in mind ?
you stay at this hotel in chinatown .
go to the maxwell food centre
that 's the cheapest place for food and the best value
because you get authentic chinese food .
do you like chinese food ?
% oh i love it .
and this place is a very old market that also has been restored .
and the good thing is you can see food that is being sold .
you can see-
in other words are you getting chicken or duck or fish .
and the people there office workers when you go on a week day
% uh they will be happy to explain to you what they 're eating if you need help .
% oh that 's nice .
so for your daughter maybe five dollars or even three dollars a plate of something
a dollar juice % uh if you like .
soya bean , a dollar as a dessert , five dollars for her .
and for your husband and yourself maybe seven or eight dollars each .
not bad .
so the food there is good , % huh ?
yes very good
% uh i eat there quite often .
what 's your favourite ?
% uh there is a chicken rice store -
% uh there are i think two stores there ,
you just look for the one with the longest queue .
it 's you know-
% uh she serves the best , you know .
it is-
she 's very generous with the ingredients chicken and the rice .
% uh and if you-
do you know porridge , rice porridge ?
yup .
% uh so that too .
so do n't order like five dollars just order the minimum
and you 'll get an idea of it .
so the taste is also the best
and the guidebooks for food have written up about her .
anything else ?
what other food do you , you know usually help yourself to ?
% uh there is what we called % uh teochew porridge .
so it is rice porridge and there are sort of variety of dishes
like steam fish , fried fish % uh salted egg , vegetables -
different vegetables cooked in different ways , tofu .
so you pick what you want and you eat it .
% uh so it depends on what you pick fish ,
% uh a whole fish of course is more expensive
if you are just taking a slice is less
and if your taking vegetables usually it 's a dollar or seventy cents a little plate .
so because it 's so cheap you can take a variety
and the three of you can share .
and so this is like close to where i 'm gon na stay if ever ?
yes very close you can walk there .
and you can even eat there every day you will not run out of stalls
okay because have so many stalls there
% uh i think over a hundred .
i see .
yah i was just looking at the picture and i can see that i could probably you know-
i could n't count the stalls there
it 's probably a very long lane of stalls right ?
but those are-
you-
mostly chinese food , nothing-
yes .
% uh there is-
there are also indian stalls selling something like % uh % uh fried pancake .
you know prata , it is a dough that is fried
and we take it with chicken curry or fish curry or mutton curry .
% um , but i 'm not really a fan of curry .
what about other food aside from indian food ?
european food maybe , western food or thai food ,
do you have thai food there ?
% uh that-
there probably is but i can not recall for sure .
usually-
i think yes there is a thai
there is what she call herself japanese
but you know it 's the cheaper type of japanese food there .
so it 's at the lower end .
maybe you pay five dollars for rice and % um % uh piece of meat
a sizeable piece of meat on your rice .
and for thai food you will get your usual green mango , you know .
% uh the sour and sweet mango
% uh and the pad thai , you know pad thai ?
no i do n't .
the noodles ,
it 's very nice , it 's a very special thai dish .
and % uh even if you do n't go to this market
% uh you can walk along the streets in chinatown
and you will be able to find thai food , you 'll be able to find % um malay food
% uh even our muslim restaurant .
so if you want to try different cuisines just outside your hotel you can find .
wow .
you have like-
we also have a food street there , it 's called smith street .
you can take this down s m i t h street
it 's the food street of singapore .
smith street , okay .
and what about the prices of the food there ?
about more or less the same .
do you go there a lot too ?
yes i go there when i 'm in chinatown
i will always eat in chinatown .
but because my place is quite near to chinatown % uh
you know i 've been-
i eat quite often , maxwell market especially .
so can you see the pictures here ?
% uh okay this one shows the food .
okay just wait a while for it to load the picture .
you see at night the road is closed off to traffic and the stalls are put out
and the stall holders man their cooking just next to the tables
% oh so it 's just like a night market of some sort .
yes , but this is for food .
for food , yah .
and in chinatown the night market is also a day market .
% oh i see .
there .
so on the next road to this is where they sell things that you can buy like souvenirs .
this is smith street where you eat .
and how far is that gon na be from the hotel ?
% uh if you walk and you stop and look at shops maybe ten minutes
otherwise i-
if you walk fast i think five minutes you can get there .
alright , that sounds good .
so you can get your souvenirs , cheap souvenirs
% uh if you need to buy like for twenty people or thirty people
you do n't want to spend a fortune .
% uh you can get things for one or two dollars % um-
really ?
yes , but % uh there would be things like you know chopsticks with % uh-
do you have pictures of that shop that you 're just talking about ?
'cause-
% uh it 's actually along the street side .
i do n't think they have a website .
it is % uh a little stalls where they sell % uh souvenirs
like during the new year they sell we~
decorations for chinese new year .
% ah okay .
what about bazaars ,
do you have like bazaars there as well ?
this would be the closest to a bazaar .
you want-
okay you want pictures of the shops
let me see if i can get it for you ?
so how long have you been doing this jeanne ?
i 've been doing it for more than twenty years .
% oh my goodness
so you really must love it , right ?
yes .
when i first did chinatown we had a street side fortune tellers
but they are gone now .
i do n't want to ask why .
% uh they are-
you know that we spruced up chinatown
that 's why if you 're worried about anything all the buildings are very clean ,
they have been conserved so they look % uh new
but in fact they are from the eighteen hundreds .
wow .
yah .
can you see the picture of the stalls there ?
so here you see the lanterns decorating the street side for the lunar new year
which is around february .
and then it 's quite crowded .
could-
but at this time that you % uh you can also buy things along chinatown
but you wo n't have to jostle with people
it will be more comfortable for you .
well that 's nice to know
i really do n't like crowds at all .
% uh yes .
so here you can see , you can get your post cards .
you-
% oh that 's nice .
can you see a little chinese costumes , if i 'm not mistaken for your % uh daughter ?
and they are not too expensive , are they ?
no .
no they are not expensive at all .
in fact some of them when they hang big signs outside their stalls
% uh usually i do n't bargain
because they are already telling you that this is a bargain .
i think i better get one of those .
that 's so nice .
yes you can get one for yourself and for your daughter as well .
i just might % uh do that .
a lot of tourists do that because they can wear their souvenir
right .
food street market .
okay .
% uh here you can see some % uh
i do n't know if you 're interested in these ,
chinese % uh artefacts .
the little dragon there , you can use it to decorate your home .
i actually have one at home .
% oh you do , okay .
yah .
they 're actually nice in the home
and they say that they bring i do n't know luck or something .
very colour~
ye~
yes .
% uh they-
during the chinese new year period before the chinese new year
we get a lot of shop selling these decorations .
i could just imagine .
% uh yes .
% hm that 's nice .
what are those things hanging there in the middle of the picture ?
this-
the brown things ?
yup .
if i 'm not mistaken this is a dried gourd , g o u r d .
it is a fruit like a melon that is dried up
and when it 's dried it hardens and they dig out the centre .
and when it 's thoroughly dried it is a container ,
it 's waterproof .
so in in china they are used to keep chinese medicines
even liquidised medicines inside these containers .
so when you give this away to somebody
it is % uh a symbol of wishing him good health and longevity .
so new year you can get them-
% uh usually you 'll give them to the older people .
it 's symbolic , nobody would put medicine in them now
we just buy it for fun .
wow .
but of course it 's available even if it 's not the new year , correct ?
no it 's available all the time .
% uh here we have something fancy , we have the fans .
okay these are the chops-
these are the fans .
% uh you might want to get one just to fan yourself when you 're walking around
and that if you take care of it , it will last .
can you see it 's a dollar ?
okay .
is that something that 's made of paper or-
paper .
and hand painted , no not really ?
% uh i think it 's printed .
you can get th~
% uh there is a calligrapher there in chinatown who will draw your-
write out your name in chinese
% uh then you 'll have to pay him accordingly .
% uh he will look at your name and he will get the phonetic translation into chinese
and try and give you a nice meaning
and then he would % uh give you a scroll with your name on it .
you can hang that in your house too .
wow that 's so nice .
maybe about ten dollars only i think .
i better get one of that .
you can bar~
that man is nice you can bargain with him .
he did it for school kids at % uh you know a few dollars
just to amuse them .
can you see at the back of the picture here these squares that are tilt over ?
% uh that is paper cut outs in red paper .
yah .
i have some myself .
% uh this is a skill from the chinese % uh are very good at .
they fold paper up and then they cut it .
and after they finish cutting they open up the paper
and you 've got this wonderful design % uh-
okay .
and the designs were like abstract or are they supposed to represent something ?
% uh usually abstract
but not abstract in the sense that you can make out what it is , you know .
% hm , okay .
that 's interesting .
do you make them ?
yah .
% oh no i ca n't make them
i 'm so-
i only buy such things .
okay these are the chopsticks
wow , colourful .
% uh if i 'm not mistaken i once saw a chopsticks for children
where they attached the two chopsticks together
so she can not lose the chopstick while she 's eating .
and she can not drop it on the floor ,
maybe you 'll get one for your daughter .
yah .
training chopsticks or some sort .
yes but the adults always buy this to train themselves .
i might get one myself .
% oh you do n't know how to use chopsticks .
right .
well i was just kidding .
okay .
we actually have % um chopsticks at home
and when i was little just for fun
my brother and i would usually use chopsticks for eating
just for the fun of it
but it 's been a while since i actually use one .
what 's that ?
it looks delicious .
okay , you 're talking about the fish ?
yes , you see the chinatown hawkers ?
that street i told about where you saw the pictures of all the stalls along the road
decorated with the lanterns ?
you can get this dish .
% uh it 's a special fish song he that the chinese like .
they believe that it can cure them of % um sickness and things like that .
and here it 's cooked .
you can see the dish it 's around fifteen dollars .
yup .
and you can tell them not to put chili if you do n't want chili
because here they cook it specially for you .
maybe a little chili but not too much .
yah , little-
here the chili looks like a garnishing
so i think it should be okay .
not too hot , right ?
yah .
okay .
do you like that ?
% uh yes i 'd like to eat that
but i have to be very careful with the bones % uh to you know .
usually we do n't eat when we-
we do n't talk when we 're eating this so we can concentrate .
you will have to pick up the bones for your daughter .
% oh so it 's a little bony .
yah the way-
because it 's near the heat to you 'll scales
you know that what 's inside the mouth here and there
but it 's very yummy to eat .
it 's where you eat and you chat and you use your fingers .
sounds like fun .
okay .
you can cross the street in chinatown safely .
can you see this bridge ?
yup .
it 's a very wide bridge and when you cross over
we have a shopping centre and shopping-
in fact shopping centres on both sides .
% oh that 's nice .
so you can categorised your shopping .
up market you can go to marina bay sands
and % uh for lesser price items , lower price items
you can do your shopping in chinatown .
alright .
so i think i got everything that i need ,
thank you so much jeanne .
and-
i 'm glad to be able to help you
i hope you enjoy your stay and your daughter too .
i think i will definitely enjoy my stay .
i hope to see you there .
yes i hope to knock in to you or meet you , alright .
yah .
okay , bye .
alright , thank you jeanne .
bye .
welcome .
bye .
hello .
hello .
good morning .
hi .
% uh this is participant number 26 .
and my name is eric .
hi eric .
my name is jeanne .
and i 'm tour guide number two .
okay .
how are you eric ?
i 'm doing good .
how about you ?
i 'm fine .
how can i help you eric ?
yah .
% uh jeanne , i was just calling in to % um ask for your assistance .
'cause % um i have a plan to visit singapore .
% um i still do n't have any fix date
but then i was looking in to going to singapore
during the night race for the formula one .
would you happen to know when
% uh one-
% oh that would be-
yes .
formula one is in september .
% uh usually , i think the third week of september .
third week of september ?
% uh who are you traveling with ?
% um i 'll be % um-
who are you traveling with ?
% um i 'll be all by myself .
all by yourself just to watch formula one ?
yes .
okay .
yes .
and i 'm also looking into % uh being there % um during the qualifying race .
okay .
so it 's % uh-
the races would be friday , saturday and sunday usually .
so it 's twenty first to twenty third of september .
okay .
and % um i 'm just looking into-
% um i 'm just looking for saturday and sunday .
% uh but then i do n't have any plans of staying there for three days
just for two days .
two days means you wants only one night in singapore ?
% uh yes .
just % um saturday and then % uh sunday evening .
and then maybe fly out % uh back to the-
% um back to the philippines % um after the race .
% oh okay .
so one night .
yes .
then you 'll have lots of money for your ticket .
% uh you do n't want to visit anywhere else in singapore ?
uh-
% um if it would still be possible if i had time
because i 'm not exactly sure about % um the schedule for the qualifying race
and then what time the actual race starts .
but then if i have time in between the qualifying and % uh what 's the-
the qualifying race and then the % um the night race itself
then i pretty much can visit different areas in singapore .
but then i 'm not sure where to go 'cause-
okay .
i think if you-
% hm if you come in early in the morning ,
you might be able to % uh do maybe just walk around your hotel i think .
and save yourself for the race .
okay .
okay .
let me see the-
sorry ?
you 're gon na ask me something ?
yah % um 'cause i only have a budget of one thousand singapore dollars .
% um wo~
is that good enough for the qualifying race alone or
would it also cover the race itself ?
you can buy the ticket for the two days .
for the two days .
% um how much is that ?
% uh let me see .
how much is that gon na cost ?
yah .
the ticket price , just a minute .
okay .
% uh early bird tickets you can buy ,
it would be a big cheaper if you are sure to be coming .
okay .
so you still qualify for the early bird race % uh purchase .
can you see ?
% oh i 'm afraid it 's a minimum of four tickets .
yah one to three tickets are thousand dollars .
okay .
% uh wait , let me see .
you can buy at places that are not so premium for watching .
okay .
i think the grandstand would do .
the bay grandstand ?
% um yah .
yes .
the bay grandstand you get a view of the-
okay let me tell you the difference .
the bay grandstand you get a view of the % uh bay that has been turned into a reservoir .
padang grandstand , it is our old colonial district .
you would be able to see maybe a longer stretch of them racing .
and % uh which area would be the starting line ?
starting line ,
i 'm not very sure , where they start the race .
let me try and find out for you .
okay .
% uh but let me have a look at the tickets first , huh ?
okay .
no problem .
okay .
i think it 's the waterfront grandstand if i 'm not mistaken .
i can not remember exactly .
but for your tickets % uh
if you buy one ticket at bay grandstand it 's only about two hundred and fifty dollars .
if you buy-
and would that-
% um that would be for the qualifying and for the night race itself ?
or just for the qualifying race ?
let me see .
% oh it doesn't-
three da~
it 's a three-day ticket category .
okay .
sounds good .
and you-
so you can actually come in one day earlier
and watch all you know the , yes three days .
okay .
maybe we can find out from here where they start % uh the race .
and % um how does it work ?
% um during the night race , you close down the s~
% uh you close your streets for the race itself ?
yes .
we close our streets and we have lots of concerts .
okay ?
so the race starts at the pit here .
can you see ?
okay .
so % uh for the-
if i buy seats % um in the pitt area-
% uh in front of the pitt area , that would be the one over a thousand dollars -
a thousand singaporean dollars ?
that 's right .
yes that 's right .
the one at the waterfront bay is here .
and this is all the sea .
and the race continues down and this is the padang .
so there is another padang % uh stand tickets .
that 's the one that is two hundred over dollars i believe .
okay .
and that-
one that i told you two hundred and forty eight dollars .
and that 's a straight line as well ?
straight line , yes .
but you get a very good view of the drivers , you know .
if they are overtaking % uh doing something rather dangerous
you can see because some of the bends there are-
it 's a bit dangerous for them .
i do n't think they overtake at those corners .
okay .
yah .
okay .
so would you suggest that there 'd be more accident happening during straight lines
rather than the-
if i was a driver , that 's what i would do .
i 'm not sure what they would do % um-
okay .
that , i think that sounds good .
% um it 's two hundred fifty something dollars , right ?
yes .
it 's two hundred and forty eight .
so you can say it 's about two hundred and fifty dollars .
okay .
so % um would that include the taxes or is it % um the taxes aren't-
it 's not part of the two fifty dollars ?
i 'm not sure but the tax , let me see , % huh ,
the ticket prices , let me go back to it .
because this is % uh billed through sistic .
it should include ,
i mean if they put in taxes , it will be a odd figure with a few cents .
okay .
i think it includes .
it does .
because it-
there is no exclusion that taxes are not included .
okay .
and you also take % um american express over % um
as payment , right ?
all your credit cards % uh would be acceptable .
okay .
% um yah , i think that the two hundred fifty % um dollar ticket prices
is good enough for me ,
so that still leaves me with seven fifty .
% um so that i can go there if i have free time .
i can you know go around singapore and possibly shop .
% oh yes .
you 'll have lots of money to shop
because you 're staying only one night .
% uh do you want to stay in a nice hotel in chinatown ?
% um what would you suggest ?
% uh let 's say for two-
'cause i would want-
as much as possible i would wan na have more money-
% um more pocket money for shopping .
more pocket money for shopping ?
then you would book a bed in a hostel .
that 's not very comfortable , right , for twenty dollars ?
you have a lot of money left over for shopping .
% uh or do you want to just have a room that is not so expensive ?
maybe around hundred dollars ?
yes .
okay .
% um , yah .
i would wanna-
definitely wan na save a bit of money for shopping .
% um but then if i look at a place to stay
and i would want it to be secure and safe .
% oh all our hostels are safe .
even our backpackers joints are safe .
they have been checked over .
and usually you 'll have lockers .
you want a cheap , safe accommodation , is it ?
okay .
okay .
% um , yes .
% uh , okay .
% uh and you do n't mind if % uh you have outside bathrooms and % uh-
the places i 've checked out before , they-
on the pictures they look very clean .
okay .
% um i would prefer to have my own bathroom inside the room .
% oh so you want to have your own bathroom .
well even at the backpackers joints
% uh there are some a little bit better value
in the sense that % uh for those who want privacy
let 's see if we can find one for you here .
okay ?
okay .
and % um it comes with an air conditioning unit .
% oh yes .
if you are having a room , definitely .
and even the backpackers joints , they have air conditioning .
because here we are rather warm and humid .
so air conditioning is like a must in hotels .
okay .
that sounds good .
and if you are serious about coming ,
i suggest you book the rooms straightaway
because at that time % uh the rooms run out very fast .
okay .
so just give us a moment .
if you book now , in fact , i think you can get your room .
% uh the category that you want
a little bit easier .
and-
and % um-
if you book-
if i book in advance % uh
do i get a discount or would it still be the regular rate ?
% uh it depends on the hotel .
% uh nowadays , the hotels know that this is a peak period .
so i do n't think you 'll get a discount .
% um in the regular hotels in fact you 'll have to pay more
like in the first class hotels % uh they charge more .
okay .
okay .
and % um since this is my first time % uh that i 'll be in singapore ,
% um are there several precautions
that % um i should be aware of ?
let 's say your laws in singapore that i should abide by .
okay .
do you want to see our rooms first ?
we are trying to % uh find out .
okay .
sure .
okay .
let me see whether we can get a picture of this-
whether they have rooms for you
because it says twenty eight dollars which would not be a room i think .
but % uh-
okay .
so twenty eight dollars a night ?
they have-
% uh let 's see if they have-
they usually show the lowest price .
okay .
% uh okay .
see they have-
% oh no .
% oh , can you see that it 's a mix dorm ?
can you see on your pre~
screen ?
yes .
so that would be six-bed mix dorm .
and % uh it 's thirty three dollars a night .
alright .
okay .
% um , do you have anything that would be more than-
% uh that 's not gon na go over fifty dollars ?
but then it 's a single room ?
single room for under fifty dollars ,
i think that 's a bit tough .
% uh that 's a bit tough .
yah ?
closer to a hundred dollars ,
you might be able to get a room % uh of your own .
a room .
okay .
yah i think that 's fine
'cause % um i still have two hundred fifty dollars to spare for the ro-
for the hotel accommodation .
% oh so if you spent-
% uh % oh you mean if you s~
your ticket is two hundred and fifty dollars ,
you have seven hundred and fifty dollars left .
yah .
'cause i wa~
'cause i plan how % um to make use of five hundred dollars for the pocket money .
and then the two hundred-
the two hundred fifty dollars for the % um for the room accommodation-
for the hotel accommodation .
that's-
wow .
two hundred and fifty dollars will get you a hotel room .
okay .
% uh okay .
let me try and find one for you .
% uh but two hundred and fifty is actually a very great ,
good , great hotel .
you do n't really need two hundred and fifty dollars .
okay .
and for two hundred fifty dollars ,
% uh do i get two nights or just one night ?
in some hotels , you would be able to get two nights .
okay .
so , let 's say less than a hundred dollars .
let us try less than a hundred .
so then you can stay two nights , right ?
% um yes .
'cause i plan to be there by sa~
maybe saturday morning .
and then , watch the qualifying race
% uh maybe the second qualifying race .
okay .
so-
okay this one-
little india is actually not less than a hundred .
but , this is a good hotel here .
it 's a hundred and fifty eight .
can you see ?
yes .
fortuna hotel .
this is in little india .
it 's a good area .
then we have budget class .
% uh the first two that states little india ,
you are very near to town
and you can get to your race very easily by the trains .
okay .
okay .
% um i actually have a question .
% um what would you highly suggest ?
% uh would you suggest that i buy a ticket for the f one race
and then % um get a separate hotel accommodation ?
or do i get a hotel accommodation that
% um that is very near the-
% um , % uh what 's this ?
the race line ?
% oh if you do that , you will bust your budget .
% uh because if you-
the hotel rates will go up during that time for the budget class hotels .
so-
so even though if i book in advance ?
let 's say a few weeks from now ?
even though you book in advan~
no .
even though you book in advance .
because the hotels know that it 's a very popular period .
and they also have to pay a small fee as a tax .
% uh so they bill it into the room rates .
so i think your priority to-
is to book your hotel first and-
or tickets .
then you have tide in your cost for your trip .
you know the two important things for you
and the rest of it you can use for shopping .
okay .
okay .
so this is a good hotel .
can you see % uh the one that 's hundred and fifty five dollars ?
% uh santa grand hotel bugis .
it 's also just one stop away from the race venue .
it 's in a shopping area .
it 's also fairly new .
i have % uh passed by a few times .
and looks % uh quite good from the outside .
okay .
so , this is a one-star hotel ?
% uh one or two stars .
yah , we do n't go by the star system in singapore
because it 's too restrictive on pricing .
but maybe i would call it two-star .
% uh lavender street .
let me see .
okay .
beach hotel , you can also walk to the race area .
hundred and thirty dollars .
% uh broadway hotel is in little india .
you can take a train .
that 's a hundred dollars .
you 'll save some money .
% um would you suggest that the hotel i take
% uh be near % um the racing venue or far from the racing venue
wherein i would have-
i would still have to take the train ?
it 's okay if you take just one stop .
% uh and in fact for one stop , i think you can walk .
i 'm assuming you 're quite young , right ?
% um yes .
yes .
so % uh that 's not a problem .
it's-
if you would travel far , then you waste time traveling .
okay .
and there are also maybe traffic jams and % uh-
because there is road closure
% uh for where the races run .
so traffic is diverted .
so it would be a good walk .
% uh if you 're on the beach road hotel , you-
it 's a very short walk .
i mean i would walk it .
i mean i suppose you could hop up a bus and take it for one stop .
but % uh there may not be buses there .
if it 's diverted , it will affect the bus route also .
so you might as well walk .
okay .
yah .
i believe it is % um-
if it includes a short walk , that would be fine .
so i can enjoy the scenery as well .
yes .
that 's right .
so you can take the-
% uh beach hotel then you walk .
or you can take % uh broadway hotel that 's in little india .
it 's quite interesting % uh because-
well if you do n't go anywhere , you just walk around the area .
% uh lots of things to see , hindu temples .
% uh are you bringing your camera ?
% um yes .
yes i am .
so you can , in the early morning
% uh when you are not involved in the-
watching the races , you can % uh take photographs
of the % uh people going there to shop ,
the people praying in the hindu temples ,
the flower garland makers .
so you can do , you know , things that tourist normally do .
you 'll get a lots of souvenir photographs when you go home .
okay .
okay .
yah .
i think-
i think that 's a-
what we had-
that-
i believe that 's a % uh it sounds like a really good deal .
% um just another question with the hotel reservation .
does it come with free breakfast ?
% uh some of them do ,
some of them do n't .
but in this area at broadway hotel , it does n't really matter
because all around you are cafes
and % uh also restaurants .
you can eat at the little cafes .
they are like coffee shops .
and if you 're vegetarian , lots of vegetarian food .
if you want some-
do you eat indian food ?
okay .
and-
% um , yes i do .
% uh so you can get north indian which is less spicy .
you can get south indian if you like your curries hot .
you can have vegetarian
and it would be just a few dollars .
okay .
so under five dollars for a good meal ?
yes .
i think under five dollars would be more than enough .
if you pay for the breakfast in the hotel ,
i believe they would cost-
it 's gon na cost me more .
they would cost you in a higher-
cost you more and then they put in a buffet spread ,
you know , jam and eggs and ham and you know
the stuff that % uh hotels normally provide .
okay .
okay .
so i think i 'm gon na enjoy singapore if i eat outside of the hotel .
so-
yes , you will .
so here .
let me see was it hun~
did it say a hundred dollars -
hundred and forty here it says .
so single without breakfast right up to december
is a hundred and forty dollars .
december of this year ?
yes .
so i think they do n't provide breakfast here .
okay .
so the hundred and forty dollars ,
that 's only good for one night ?
yes , for one night .
okay .
'cause i think i 'll be needing two days .
that 's right .
if you have two days , then you % uh little bit more relax , you know .
after you have landed and you have a bit more time to sightsee .
so two fifty for the tickets
another two hundred and eighty for your two nights ,
right ?
yah .
% um yes .
so you have four hundred and seventy dollars left to spend .
okay .
and % um where would four hundred eighty dollars
get me % um for shopping in singapore ?
is that good enough-
% uh is that a good enough money or-
if you-
what are you looking for in shopping ?
i 'm not exactly sure what i 'm gon na get .
% um but then what i 've heard is that
% um the electronics or the gadgets in singapore ,
its price significantly lower in comparison to the other asian markets .
i do n't have prices for the items .
but there 's a centre i will recommend you to .
it 's % uh an it centre .
so they have laptops , they have the peripherals .
and what i normally advice people to do
is to go around the stores .
be honest and tell them you are checking prices
and you 'll come back if they are giving you a good deal .
okay .
and % um is there also flea market in singapore ?
yes .
% uh in fact if you ask me ,
i think little india looks like a flea market
with all the stalls filling out into the street .
but you can go to a place called bugis ,
where we have a little lane and there are lots of little stalls
selling very low priced % um souvenirs .
okay .
okay .
and what would you suggest
% um would be a good souvenir to buy , let 's say when i get back ?
% uh one of the souvenirs that should people normally buy
is of the merlion % uh sort of-
% uh just an ornament to put on the table .
and how much do they usually cost ?
% uh depends on the size of the item .
they have them really small for people who want tiny things .
and they have them bigger
and it depends on , you know , what it is made of .
so if you go to a good class store ,
it might cost you fifteen , twenty dollars .
if you buy it on the street side ,
i think would be two , three dollars ,
you should be able to get it .
it 's not expensive .
okay .
that 's good .
and % um-
now here , you ca-
yah , go ahead .
sorry .
so here is an air conditioned area
% uh within a shopping mall that is next to a hotel
in the same district of bugis .
and what we 've done is we 've conserved the old buildings .
can you see the windows here ?
yes .
on the right side .
so is that a-
% um is this-
is that a food market ?
% uh no .
this is-
well there is food all around .
but here it seems to be having a food fair .
so that , i think that was when it was photographed .
but generally , they have stalls selling a whole lot of things .
if you want to buy % uh scarfs for your girlfriend ,
you want to buy handbags or you want to buy % uh like you say souvenirs .
you can get them here .
so if you think it 's too hot and you want somewhere air conditioned ,
you can shop in here .
okay .
okay .
but just opposite is the lane
where you % uh have shops on your left and right .
and you have a whole range of items from
% uh t-shirts that young people like to wear ,
% uh and % uh even buddha statues ,
% uh cd 's even at times .
and this is some of the food you can eat .
okay .
and what singapore -
% uh what is singapore 's % um food delicacy ?
% um is it chinese ?
is it indian ?
is it something else different ?
or what would you suggest that i eat
% uh that would make a big difference
or that would make me remember singapore for their food ?
well , do you like curry ?
or you prefer something that is not so hot ?
% um i would wan na try something very different
% um that is % uh none western in nature .
i would want it to be something that is authentic of singapore .
okay .
okay .
here can you see the stall here on your left ?
that 's a peking duck , right ?
can you see the ch~
no , that 's chicken .
very fat chicken .
and right at the end of the brown bird
you can see a pale white one .
% oh okay .
okay .
% uh at these stalls , you usually can get two kinds
% uh roasted or you can get it a normal chicken rice .
% uh the chicken is boiled with pandan .
do you know pandan leaves that are fragrance ?
% um yes .
and so % uh the chicken is boiled
and then the soup that is used to boil the chicken ,
is used to cook the rice .
and in the rice they tie up pandan leaves to give the rice fragrance .
and they add a little bit of oil so the rice in itself ,
in fact when i was a child i used to eat a lot of just the rice .
we pour thick black sauce over it .
and if you like to have it hot , then you take a vinegarish chili .
the chili is ground with % um a little bit of vinegar sauce .
but if you do n't like , that 's optional .
and the chicken is very delicious .
okay .
okay .
okay .
so it 's more of-
you can also eat .
okay .
so it 's more of the broth of the chicken
% uh that 's the same thing that you use for cooking the rice , is that it ?
% uh yes .
yes .
and then you get a soup .
the soup comes free of charge .
okay .
and how much would that cost ?
is it-
would it be a cup of rice or is it just how-
like how many servings ?
% uh sometimes they have a fix deal
three dollars a plate .
% uh sometimes it 's two dollars .
but i think two dollars will not be enough for you .
and also the cuts of meat , you know .
if you want to have the thigh of the chicken which is very popular ,
maybe you have to pay three fifty .
and some places-
yah at fifty cents per rice .
they will charge you another fifty cents .
okay .
okay .
so that 's one delicacy that i can try out
maybe when i get there .
yes .
that is something that 's a favourite with locals
and with tourist as well .
okay .
and what else would you suggest ?
% um something else authentic
or something authentic or different ?
some-
okay .
something that 's very nice % uh that % uh we like and tourist like
and the restaurants are-
the food vendors are very good at .
they will make it with a little bit less chili .
okay .
and would you suggest i eat from a restaurant
or from the side street vendors ?
if you want to save money for shopping
then you go for the side street vendors .
if you want to have % uh to pamper yourself ,
then you can eat at the restaurants .
% uh the dish i am recommending is chili crab .
okay .
okay .
okay .
and this is something that 's only available in the restaurant
or do they also sell this in the side street ?
% uh so-
usually at the restaurants .
% uh normally this meal you share it with friends
because it 's finger licking good .
and as you break up the crab ,
they give you something to-
they 've smashed the crab a little bit
so that you can get at the meat inside % uh the shell .
but then % uh there are parts of it you ca n't reach
so they give you a little fork to dig in .
and then you % uh-
buns .
can you see here at the description ?
okay .
yes .
served with steam deep fried buns .
these are very nice and soft buns % uh with nothing inside .
so you dip this bun into the gravy .
okay .
so % um what 's that ?
mantau ?
is it mantau or mantou ?
yes .
that 's right .
it 's mantou that is % uh usually served in chinese food .
when i was young , we % uh just add it with plain white bread .
so what-
if you order this , i suggest you just order this
and do n't order anything else .
so you can eat the whole crab .
okay .
okay .
so the-
okay .
so % um and the mantou is the one that they use for the dumplings , right ?
% uh yes .
but this is a mantou with just a slice .
and then it 's empty .
it 's empty inside .
so the idea is that instead of eating rice ,
you use the mantou to wipe out the sauce and eat that .
that would be your carbohydrate .
the bread .
okay .
it 's a sweet .
% uh not so sweet .
it 's chili with % uh sweet sauce
so that the sweetness balances the chili .
okay .
and how much does this cost ?
it goes by the crab .
so it varies with the price of the crab .
it could be maybe i would say not more than forty dollars .
wow .
that 's expensive .
a whole crab , yah .
% uh maybe thirty-
i 'm estimating on the highest side
in case the price of the crab goes up at the time .
% uh the thing is they sell it by the crab
and they will weigh the crab .
so it 's alright if you go and ask how much they weight
and % um that would n't be impolite , right ?
no .
% uh i do it all the time .
if i too expensive ,
% uh yah .
but % uh as i said , this dish is very nice
if you have a few people to share .
then you order things like vegetables .
and let me see what do we have here .
i ca n't recognise this dish .
let 's have a look at this .
% oh this is-
clams .
% uh yah .
clams steamed and they have mixed garlic .
and it 's a light dish .
so this % uh clams , they actually looked like bamboo .
that 's why they 're called bamboo clams .
okay .
and this is also priced at forty dollars or lower ?
no . would-
this would be much less .
maybe twelve fifteen .
it varies with the restaurants .
% uh the-
jumbo is a very popular restaurant and it 's got a few branches .
they have one restaurant
which is very near to the f one % uh race track .
okay .
okay .
okay .
it 's along the river .
and so it 's very convenient for you .
okay .
% um do they raise their prices during race day ?
or is it % um-
do they have a fixed amount for the food ?
no .
i do n't think they raise their prices .
% uh they only li-
raise prices % uh for some restaurants during the lunar new year .
% uh but if they raise prices , it would be , you know , on the menu
or they would be assigned to tell you .
they would n't suddenly give you a bill , you know ,
that is higher than what 's on the menu .
that 's good .
so you can see-
can you see a view of the restaurant ?
it 's a nice place .
% um yes .
% um is that a river ?
yes .
that is the river which is right next to the f one % uh race track .
okay .
and it opens out into the marina bay
which is now our reservoir .
% uh which collects rainwater that falls in the city .
so , you know , the ambiance is very nice .
okay .
you just have to look at the menu before you order
and ask them to weigh the crab .
okay .
and that you do n't have to eat the crab if you do n't like .
you can have steamed prawns .
you can have a fish .
% uh generally in singapore , the fish and crabs and prawns
% uh would be the higher price items .
if you are vegetarian , it 's much cheaper to eat .
okay .
okay .
% um i just have another question .
% um if i go to singapore , would i enjoy the food if i eat in the restaurant
or would i get a better taste of singapore
if i take my food and buy it from the street vendors ?
if you buy it from the street vendors ,
% uh you are getting more singaporean taste .
you know what i mean ?
% um you are getting what i would be eating without busting my budget .
if you go into the restaurants ,
you are getting sometimes it is modified to the taste of the tourist .
that means the chili maybe a little bit left out .
% uh if you are buying off the street ,
you can ask them-
you-
well you can ask them to reduce the chili .
when they can , they will reduce it for you .
but otherwise , for two dollars or three dollars ,
they will give you what they have .
and you know % uh it would be maybe a little bit more adventurous .
okay .
% hm , okay .
that 's good .
the vendors in little india are very accommodating .
they 're very friendly .
so i eat there quite often .
and you would obviously look like a tourist .
so they would be happy to accommodate you .
okay .
% uh that sounds really good .
and % um is-
i just wan na get a bigger picture .
would four hundred dollars go along way
for two days in singapore ?
four hundred dollars to spend ?
yes .
for-
% uh or to shop ?
to spend , that 's a lot of money .
i do n't spend that much in a week .
% uh it's-
okay .
or even two days , right ?
yah .
no .
that 's a lot of money in singapore .
% hm okay .
so four hundred dollars ,
that 's good enough for food and then for shopping ?
yes for food .
you can even eat your crab .
% uh you will still have money left over .
and you can eat street food also .
you do n't want to blow it all on restaurants , right ?
so in little india ,
if you eat in the little cafes ,
% uh it will cost you % uh ten dollars if you order more than one dish .
ten dollars .
if you will order-
yah .
if you walk in , % uh there 's a little indian restaurant opposite a hindu temple .
the road is called veerasamy road .
i do n't think they are on the internet .
but they will have different % uh vegetarian
like pancakes cooked with unions , % uh cooked with potatoes inside .
they 're just between one dollar and maybe two fifty .
that 's all .
okay .
so it 's not expensive .
and % uh does singapore also provide or serve ethnic food ?
ethnic food would be the food you get in little india .
in chinatown , would be the chinese food .
okay .
but then is there something that is % um
something that would really describe , yah , the food in singapore
or let 's say % um it 's singaporean brand type of food .
is there something like that ?
chicken rice and chili crab are very singaporean
because we % uh supposed to have adopted the chicken rice from china
but we have revolutionalised it , so it 's totally our own brand .
and the chili crab also .
% um during chinese new year , we have another one .
it 's called yusheng that we tossup .
it 's a salad that we eat .
and that 's also singaporean .
but that 's normally you get it when you come before the lunar new year .
okay .
so % uh they do n't serve that kind of salad
on let 's say during september or maybe this month ?
no , they serving that .
because it 's superstitious when we eat that
as we add the ingredients and we toss it up .
we say auspicious things in chinese
to bring us wealth , good health , lots of grandchildren and things like that .
okay .
maybe i can-
what 's this ?
i can come back to singapore and-
just come back to singapore and try out that salad .
yes .
it 's very nice .
% uh you 've got to come before the new year
because during the chinese new year ,
some of the restaurants maybe closed for the first day or the second day
to give their staff a break .
and that 's % uh in february ?
% uh you have to check the chinese calendar .
so it changes because it 's not a gregorian calendar .
okay .
very interesting .
and % um what else would you suggest that i do
% um aside from the f one race
and then trying out the singaporean delicacies ?
okay .
you want to-
is there anything else that i can do ?
let 's say if-
you wanted to % uh buy some % uh computer peripherals .
is that right ?
you were mentioned it just now ?
% um yes .
but that 's also one thing that i 'm considering .
but then is there anything else that i can do
to make my first trip to singapore memorable ?
okay .
% uh we have-
wait .
let me show you funan centre first .
and funan centre is-
is this a mall ?
it's-
yes .
it 's a mall .
it's-
% uh when it 's open , it 's dedicated to computer items .
information technology shops .
and can you see city hall there ?
so it 's just next door to city hall .
okay .
and would your-
what 's this ?
would your sub courts and your-
what 's this ?
your supreme court also be in the city hall or is it in a different place ?
it is in the area but % uh city hall and the supreme court right now
they are molded up % uh for the-
% uh they are no longer functioning as % uh court or government officers ,
but they are gon na be turn into one big % uh museum and art gallery .
so , you know , % uh it 's not there for you to photograph .
it would n't look so nice .
okay .
but % um is that a
restricted area for tourist to take photographs of ?
no .
not restricted .
and the actual court is just behind it .
so if you look at the padang .
can you see connaught drive ?
sort of where the word singapore is ?
yes .
% uh if you are booking your tickets ,
you 'll be sitting right here opposite connaught drive .
okay .
and behind it would be funan mall .
so your computer shops are there .
and then if you have time at night ,
you can walk along % uh the river .
can you see boat quay ?
you-
can see you a little blue curvy line ?
that 's our historic river .
okay .
and % um where is jumbo located ?
the jumbo restaurant .
is it along side boat quay ?
and there are-
okay .
yes . so do you see boat quay ?
yes . so do you see boat quay ?
it 's on the opposite banks of % uh the hill street area
where the road name is shown .
so can you see % uh merchant road ?
so before merchant road , it 's right along the river .
it 's along there .
if you walk along it , you can not miss it .
so % um would you consider that a short walk or is it a long walk ?
it 's a short walk .
i walk much more than that every time i 'm in the area .
okay .
% um is that a five-minute or ten-minute walk ?
if you walk fast , just five minutes .
otherwise if you are looking at things which i presume you will be doing ,
maybe ten minutes .
okay .
that 's good .
there is also an interesting museum just behind
% um where you see the boat quay name ?
can you see ?
so across the river from there is the asian civilisation 's museum .
and you can visit that too .
the-
then that would be the one that they commercialise
or they show in the history channel ?
% oh i do n't know about the history channel .
% uh this museum shows you the early history of singapore
in the front foyer .
i 'm sorry .
and % uh-
% um it was-
is that the old british office ?
yes that 's right .
that 's the old british office that used to be a government office .
okay .
okay .
that 's good .
let me get it for you .
and can tour~
% um would i be allowed as a tourist to take photographs of the museum ?
% uh not inside the exhibits there .
because % uh i think one is for security reasons
and sometimes people forget to switch off their flash
and you would fade the exhibits .
and they have , you know , old fabrics and % uh artifacts
that would suffer from too much light .
so for some of the exhibits , it 's actually a little bit dim .
okay .
so we have an exhibit on south asia that would be india .
we have one there you see some of the statues that we have on display ?
okay .
so i can definitely take pictures as long as i turn off the flash ?
yes but you check with the security before you enter
% uh just to be sure , yah .
% um we have an southeast asian exhibit .
% uh this is my favourite .
it 's west asia .
it 's a room where you find out about % uh the islamic culture
and they have got old calligraphy ,
% uh small little e~
korans , you know , the holly book for the muslims
with hand drawn calligraphy .
okay .
if you like , you can also visit this museum ,
the peranakan museum which is also nearby .
and would i have to pay an entrance fee ?
or can i enter the museum without paying anything ?
% uh for the asian civilisation 's museum ,
the outside area that shows you the singapore history and the history of the river ,
that one-
that one is % uh free of charge .
so if you go too late and you think you have no time
% uh then i suggest you go to visit just the outside area
and you can take photographs from there into the river .
so you get a good view .
okay .
okay .
okay .
can you see this picture here ?
% um yes .
% uh so let me see , huh .
so the acm is here .
your % um seats for watching the f one
is where the cricket club is just around the corner .
okay .
so walking distance and your % uh rice , chicken -
% uh sorry your chili crab is down boat quay
just a little bit further down .
let me see if i can get the prices for you .
i know it 's ten dollars only .
ten dollars for the museum entrance ?
yes .
it should n't be more than ten dollars
in fact eight dollars .
okay .
well that 's really-
that 's an affordable price .
okay .
very affordable .
and you may even get it free ,
that 's talk about allowing you free entry to the museums .
and % uh do they also sell souvenirs in the museum ?
yes .
there is a museum shop but % uh the souvenirs are very good quality .
so they are not low price .
% hm okay .
% uh although they do have certain items on sale now and then .
okay .
that 's good .
i think souvenirs you get from chinatown and little india
you would save money .
% uh and then you can buy your computer it products from funan centre .
okay .
sounds really good .
four hundred dollars is a lot of money .
you can eat your chili crab .
okay .
i definitely consider that .
so i can eat the chili crab .
i just wan na make sure that i get everything correct .
so there 's a chili crab , there 's a chicken rice ?
yes % uh-
and then i can also eat curry in the indian % um-
% uh what 's this ?
in the-
what do you call that ?
the indian city ?
yes .
% uh the indian restaurants there % um in little india .
okay .
and my hotel is near-
% uh it 's a walk , it 's walking distance from the race venue
and the race venue is also near the museum .
and the restaurant for the chili crab is also walking distance ?
so-
the-
if you take the beach road -
the hotel that was located at beach road ,
that one is walking distance .
if you take the one-
and that 's a hundred and forty dollars ?
yes .
if you take the one in little india ,
you have to take a train .
unless you do n't mind walking a little bit more .
okay .
i would n't mind .
i definitely enjoy singapore walking .
yes .
do you want to see a map of the % uh train ?
the so~
% um yes .
i would definitely appreciate it .
'cause i think i have n't shown you that , right ?
% um yes .
yah .
i have n't seen it yet .
and your mrt map-
% uh what is
your mrt .
how does one train ride cost ?
it goes by distance .
so it depends on how far you travel .
and from what you have planned ,
it 's not very far .
so % uh maybe the longest distance would be from the airport to the city .
so you get your ticket from the basement of changi airport .
can you see on the right side of your map ?
okay .
okay .
% hm changi .
okay .
yah .
okay that 's station number three .
you take it to tanah merah .
and you have to get off and switch on a train that goes westwards .
okay .
and when you go down westwards , you travel down .
if you are going to book into the hotel in little india ,
you switch-
you-
i think you go all the way down to outram park , that would be easier .
and then you get off and get on what we call the north east line which is purple .
okay .
okay .
can you see the purple line ?
% um yes .
so that 's outram park very near to chinatown .
you turn north east .
there are hotels also in chinatown
but you can carry on to little india .
and that 's only one , two , three , four stops .
that would be maybe your most expensive ride
% hm under three dollars , singapore money .
okay .
that 's very affordable .
yes .
and the rest of your rides would be from little india % uh down to-
if you want to go to chinatown , it 's two stops .
you can also stop at clarke quay which is % uh-
that 's the river .
yah it 's the river .
is that the river ?
okay .
yes .
and you could walk from clarke quay % uh to the f one sites .
% uh and also to where you eat .
okay .
and the marina bay is also part of the racing line ?
yes .
you see the bay .
so when you take photographs , you have the bay in your background .
% um and when you walk around , you can see the marina bay sands
which is one of our two % um integrated resorts .
beautiful view for the background .
if you % uh do n't want to get off at clarke quay ,
you can also go to city hall from dhoby ghaut .
can you see ?
you switch to city hall station .
and that 's also in the area .
% uh city hall is maybe a little bit nearer-
two minutes nearer to where you would be seated for your show .
for your-
well i call it a show for the f one race .
okay .
and % um your mrt system ,
is it a subway or is it an elevated type of mrt system ?
it 's a mix .
it's-
part of it is above ground .
when you come down from the airport ,
you get a good view until kallang , yes .
and then it goes underground because that area is built-up .
and in the chinatown area , it is all % uh built-up so it is underground .
but when you go out of the city , it is above ground for some parts .
% uh the purple line is mostly underground .
okay .
and this mr syste~
mrt system that you 're showing me , it covers entire singapore ?
almost all of singapore .
but it 's also integrated with a bus system .
so for example % uh at paya lebar where you have an interchange ,
there are lots of buses there to cover areas not covered by the mrt .
at dhoby ghaut , there are lots of buses as well and at city hall .
we also have a bus information board behind
where you sit , you can read off and find information .
where about-
you know where the buses would bring you to .
okay .
okay .
and your bus system also has-
% uh does it follow a strict schedule ?
it follows a strict schedule but we ca n't control the traffic .
so the traffic-
if there is a build-up of traffic , then there would be a delay .
% hm sometimes we grumble because the same bus number comes-
two of the buses come together .
but it 's not the fault of the driver or the scheduler .
it 's because of the traffic .
okay .
okay .
and what 's this ?
% uh your bus system and your mrt system ,
is it a twenty four hour transportation system or are there-
is there a schedule for both of them ?
no .
that-
it 's not twenty four hours .
% uh past midnight .
for the f one , they would be extended for sure .
% uh they would publicize it
that they would extend it maybe for an hour or two .
because they know a lot of people need to get home
and so they need to provide the % uh transportation .
we also have a night rider system where the buses bring people from areas like
% uh chinatown , % uh the night clubbing areas back into the major cities .
this is more to service singaporeans who have a night out
and you know they do n't drive .
they can get home near enough to their homes .
okay .
okay .
and is there a place in singapore
that % um % uh i should avoid visiting tha-
that 's un~
% uh that 's considered an unsafe area ?
the-
% uh unsafe area ?
i really can not think of any unsafe area
as long as you do n't % um , you know , wear jewelry like gold chain and gold
% uh you know some people-
some men like to wear gold bracelets , you know ,
that are solid gold and cost thousands of dollars now .
so if you do that , you probably might invite trouble .
% uh one place that 's a bit shady is called geylang .
but to me , it 's very colourful .
i have been there .
it 's % uh-
we have some-
let me see if i can get you pictures there .
it is a little bit out of the way .
% uh you get authentic food there .
you can also-
can you see on your screen ?
okay .
yes .
% um jeanne ?
% um what % uh-
what 's this ?
i just wan na thank you for , you know ,
for enlightening me with % um the places that i could visit in singapore .
and i believe % uh i have all the-
everything that i ha~
everything that i need for my trip this is~
this september .
okay .
% uh i hope you will come and remember to buy your tickets early
so that you can % uh enjoy the cheaper rate
for the hotel before it gets filled up .
yes .
i will keep that in mind .
okay .
yah .
well thank you very much for your time .
i appreciate it .
alright .
you do n't want to wait for the picture of geylang ?
no ?
okay .
alright then .
goodbye .
yah that 's fine .
yah thank you very much .
okay .
have a good day .
goodbye .
thank you .
yah .
thank you .
bye .
goodbye .
bye .
bye eric .
bye .
bye .
hello .
hello .
hello , good morning or good afternoon .
this is jeanne .
guide number two .
hi .
hi , good morning ms. jeanne .
this is maggie .
i 'm participant number twenty-eight .
how are you maggie ?
i 'm doing great and how about you ?
i 'm fine too .
how can i help you maggie ?
% uh , yah .
i 've actually % uh planning a trip % uh to singapore soon .
% uh some time in april .
and % um % uh it 's just going to be me , my boyfriend and i 'm going to carry like a small dog with me .
% uh i ca n't live anywhere without it .
so , i wan na know how that 's going to be possible .
you want to bring your dog ?
d o g , dog ?
did you say ?
yes .
i 'm afraid you ca n't do that , because your dog will have to be quarantined .
% oh i see .
yes .
so , % um if you bring it in your dog will still not be with you .
he will be put in quarantine .
you can not carry your dog with you in the hotel and bring it into singapore .
% oh that 's sad .
so , i have to find someone else to babysit my baby .
yes .
you have to find someone to babysit .
okay .
well-
okay , i 'm not sure .
i do n't think there 'll be a problem
% um well , 'cause me and my boyfriend are planning to go there around mid-april
% uh whatever is available .
and we planned to stay there for a week .
so , % um i have really-
one-
i have re~
yes .
one week ?
% uh what is your % uh intention ?
you want to have a room or are you willing to go backpacker style .
so , you want to save money for shopping .
well , okay .
that i think we 've been discussing .
% uh he is-
my boyfriend is on the % uh cheap side .
yah .
but % uh i wan na make sure that we 're both comfortable .
% um as long as the room has everything we need , air-conditioned .
% uh we 're not going to carry much stuff .
because % uh we planned to go around .
and , you know savour all the delicacies that singapore has to offer .
for wha~
okay .
okay .
so you want backpacker , but you want to have a room .
or rather the lowest priced rooms that you can get .
is that it ?
% um well , not too low though .
% um i like a bit of luxury .
% oh you like a bit of luxury .
we will look for it and see whether we can % uh accommodate you .
but how much money are you going to spend ?
% um , okay .
% uh i have about a thousand % uh singapore dollars that i-
as my budget .
is that for yourself ?
is your boyfriend sharing % uh like he 's gon na put in another thousand ?
% um well , 'cause i 'm not sure about ho~
you know , how the rate is over there .
and % uh how much we 're going to need for , you know to visit all the sightseeing ,
go around eating .
possibly , % um go on tours .
well-
% uh tours , you can do yourself .
let me see if i can get you % uh rooms .
% uh , okay .
because you really-
you do n't want dormitory .
you also want to have % uh a room , right ?
so-
yes .
% uh with a tv , a hot shower and service-
room service .
okay , % uh % hm .
yap .
% oh so that 's not really backpacker , right ?
that would be a hotel .
% uh not a very high price hotel .
yah .
yah .
something that 's % uh , you know affordable by middle class families .
okay .
let me see .
so , like aside from just the food in singapore .
what else is there any to ?
what is your interest ?
% um well , i like % uh % um animals pretty much .
% um i like , you know i wan na see all kinds of animals that you do n't get to see in the states . .
% um i like , you know i wan na see all kinds of animals that you do n't get to see in the states . .
okay , animals .
% uh anything else ?
% um aside from food .
i also like , you know % uh a lot of % uh beaches .
% uh theme parks , if there 're any .
and % uh going to nightclubs where there is a band .
yap .
okay .
% oh and-
yes and shopping is a must .
% oh yes , of course .
then , there are lots of shops all over singapore .
okay .
here are some hotels here .
yah , % uh % hm .
we have to look at your budget .
alright .
le~
let 's look at under a hundred .
well , at-
what is shown here this one at eighty-five .
it 's a bit high price .
i mean , sorry .
it 's a bit low price , but it 's % uh bit out of the way .
yah bu~
out of the way like is it somewhere-
what do you mean out of the way ?
% uh it is in what-
some of us considered a little shady part of singapore .
full of colour actually .
i think with your boyfriend it should be okay .
but you have to walk a little distance to where the trains are .
% uh if you 're in town , this is a bit better .
okay .
well , it would be great if it 's close to where , you know there are places to eat .
so , we do n't have to walk so far .
yes , % uh-
now , you-
if you look at the screen , there are hotels .
in chinatown .
the keong saik hotel at ninety dollars .
okay .
and we also have in little india asphodel inn .
% uh race course road is % uh in little india and it 's eighty dollars .
so , what is your preference to be ?
in an area where you can get out and get chinese food ?
or where you can get indian food easily ?
% oh that 's something i have to talk with about my-
you know , to talk about with my boyfriend .
'cause he is a big fan of chinese food , but i like both .
and i also like indian food a lot more than i do chinese food .
so , is there anything else that 's in between ?
% uh if you stay in chinatown .
you are closer to places like % uh museums .
and some of the train stations .
and you can also get indian food in chinatown .
and it 's only a short distance .
two to three stops through little india .
where you can choose from a whole variety of indian food .
well , so it sounds like that % uh hotel near the chinese restaurant is the winner .
yes , that 's right .
keong saik street .
% uh ninety dollars is actually a very good deal .
because it 's right in town .
% uh and it is near the civic district , which is our historic area and near the river .
yes
so , very easy .
yah .
that sounds pretty great .
% uh do you know what kind of % uh amenities that the hotel offers ?
okay .
let 's have a look here .
so is-
can you see ?
it's-
yes , i can .
% uh hm .
okay .
so , they have a bar there .
alright , they have laundry .
and % uh air-conditioned rooms , % uh mini bars , telephone , shower , internet access .
alright .
% uh is that like % uh free wi-fi ?
wi-fi .
it does n't say wi-fi , right ?
do i see wi-fi ?
no .
and that something i'm-
alright , that something i have to enquire with the hotel .
no , i do n't se-
alright , so-
it does n't sa~
we have internet access here .
can you see ?
yap .
in your room .
i ca-
% oh in the room itself .
okay .
alright .
not bad .
that-
is n't that for ninety dollars per night ?
it 's very good .
can you see it won in a ha~
architectural heritage award ?
that sounds like a big deal .
they did win an award .
yes , that-
that means the building is a pretty building .
okay .
yah , it does look like .
% uh from the picture that i saw .
okay , just a minute .
i 'm trying to get you a bigger picture of it .
yah , this is the picture .
okay .
% oh looks like cute .
it 's in a conservation area .
and the buildings were totally renovated .
so , they would maybe late eighteen hundreds or early nineteen hundreds .
i 'm not very clear on the exact date .
but they have been totally refurbished and redone .
so , they got an award because they have done it sensibly .
wow .
so , you are in % uh one of my favourite districts with all these history around you .
and yet you have clean rooms .
you have % uh the convenience of % uh shopping just outside .
food .
yah .
it looks very nice and-
wow .
so , i will-
show you where it is .
yah .
that would be great .
so , like how far is it from the airport ?
okay .
i will show you on the map in a little while .
there is a stop on the trains .
but you will have to change trains .
which i think is not a problem for you .
right ?
yap .
% oh okay .
so , i have to take .
is it like % uh subway or is it % um one of those % uh skyway trains ?
% uh it is-
as our system is known as mass rapid transit .
and it is % uh a mixture of above ground and below ground .
alright .
okay , so that little % uh inn is where the hotel is ?
yes .
and there is % uh two stops that will bring you near here .
one is the outram park .
the other one is on the other side and it 's called chinatown .
so , you can just walk to where your hotel is .
it 's on % uh slightly quieter part of chinatown .
there are other hostels in the other side lanes .
uh % % hm .
where we have food stalls and souvenir shops .
so , this is a nice lane .
% uh that used to be a red light district , but no more .
in my grandfather 's time , it was .
okay .
okay .
that i would have been worried if it was a red light district .
because i bring my boyfriend .
no .
it ' s not a red light district at all .
okay .
so , they pretty much made it % uh a tourist spot or upscale place ?
% uh not really only for tourist .
for locals as well .
it 's just the hotels are aim at the tourist .
% uh but the food and the % uh-
i mean singaporeans visit the place .
you will know when you visit there .
you 'll see a lot of locals shopping , eating .
so , % uh you soak in the atmosphere .
okay .
so , % uh if it is in-
if it is in % uh area of chinatown , i got-
do i have to communicate ?
they will bring a translator or something to speak to them ?
or do all them understand english ?
they would understand english .
if you speak slowly .
% um % hm , okay .
and if you are negotiating prices .
what i do when i visit % uh some other countries is that i bring a calculator .
and i key in the amount i want to pay for whatever i 'm buying .
% oh i see , alright .
so , you will just show the price instead of saying it to them .
yes .
and so that 's because you do n't want them to misunderstand you .
okay .
i see .
alright , would then make sense .
but-
most of the shopkeepers and the people who sell things along the roadside ,
they understand basic english .
so , it should not be a problem .
you may have problem understanding them .
because we speak singlish .
we combined english with chinese grammar .
wait .
what 's it called again ?
it 's % uh singlish .
that 's an interesting term .
singlish .
yes .
singapore english .
i wonder , when i heard it i was thinking , okay .
it sounds like they 're singing english .
okay .
no , singlish % uh .
that 's pretty cool .
the-
yes , % uh % uh .
% uh so if you ca n't understand them ,
just ask them to repeat what they are saying .
% oh but do all them sounds like you ?
i mean , yah you speak english pretty well .
% uh yes % uh but if i went to chinatown .
i sort of naturally speak singlish a little bit .
% uh because i adopt what people are telling me .
so % uh singlish for example , why you 're so like that ?
do you understand me ?
% oh wait i heard-
i heard-
i heard someone say that before .
'cause-
i think there was a song about that .
% uh with the same words .
yes .
we had % uh singer composer who is very popular .
who composed songs and music with using singlish .
that 's interesting .
i should look for that .
% uh occasionally , we 've got malay words thrown in .
but % uh it is very local .
% oh , okay .
cool , alright .
% oh anyway , % um i just realised 'cause i was looking at the dates that i was planning to trip for .
and % um apparently there is a conflict .
% um boyfriend just texted me and he says we can only go for about one or two days .
that 's quite a short tour .
so-
% uh that will leave you a lot of money for shopping if you just-
you see , if you spend two days ninety dollars ,
you can spend two days , right ?
then , yah .
exactly , not bad .
but it 's still such a short trip .
so , huh ?
yes . it 's a hundred and eighty dollars .
yes . it 's a hundred and eighty dollars .
so , you said you wanted animals ?
so-
% um , yes .
there-
is there like a zoo or % uh some sort of % uh a farm ?
yes .
can i get you singapore wildlife safari or singapore wildlife reserves ?
% oh is there a difference ?
can you tell me the difference between the two ,
what they offer ?
the reserves is the % uh governing body for the bird park , the zoo and the night safari .
and , the zoo and night safari are next to each other .
so , i suggest you buy a ticket for all three attractions .
and you could visit all three in a day or you could do two on one day .
and spend a morning at the bird park and you have the afternoon free .
wow .
so , how far is that from the hotel ?
% uh when i get back to the screen i 'll show you .
it 's on the west line and you 'll just have to connect .
and take a short bus ride there .
okay .
okay .
so , here you 're seeing a free-flight aviary within the jurong bird park ,
which is part of the wildlife reserves .
okay .
% oh sounds like an awesome place .
yes .
% uh very good for photography .
well , 'cause my boyfriend is more interested at-
like interacting with the animals rather than taking pictures with them .
% oh you can see the show and you can-
when you enter , you just get a leaflet ,
or if they have % uh more specific brochure on the timings .
if there is none printed out ,
you just ask the girl at ticketing .
the guest relation officers will advise you % uh when are the feeding times .
% oh wow .
okay .
but -- -
so , where you saw the birds feeding just now ,
yes .
they usually put out bird food and fruits .
very near to the pathway where you are walking .
% oh are we allowed to like go near the birds and feed them in some way ?
at feeding time if the keeper is there , he will % uh-
you can buy let 's say of just a few dollars for the bird feed .
and you can either hold it up in your little plastic container .
or if you are brave , you put the seed on your hand ,
and they will feed of your hand .
% uh that would be great .
it just an-
it sounds like a great thing , a package .
so , % um like % uh what are the prices for , you know if it 's like a whole day thing ?
or % um do we just have to pay upon entrance and then we have to pay for other attractions within that area ?
yes .
% uh can i show you the other attractions first and then i come to the pricing ?
sure .
so , this is the bird park .
so , this is at a different location from where the zoo and the night safari are located .
% uh because the zoo and night safari are just next door to each other .
so , if we look at the zoo .
so , that would be convenient .
yes . so , i suggest to-
yes . so , i suggest to-
because the night safari opens at seven .
so , you visit the zoo in the afternoon ,
and the night safari in the evening .
the same day .
so , you just walk across .
okay .
wow .
what is that ?
that 's % uh a new nudist .
% uh it is a mole rat .
% uh a mole rat .
wha~
yes .
and it does n't have any hair .
so , that 's why they called it a nudist % uh colony .
% uh that looks quite scary .
it 's the first time ever i 've seen a mole-
a naked mole rat .
wow .
yes .
but % uh they will not be in your face , you know .
% um it 's optional whether-
% uh in fact , i do n't think you will be able to handle the mole rats .
% um of course not .
% uh any kind of wildlife % uh should n't be touch their , you know .
it 's great to see them from afar , but-
obviously , we should-
% uh you-
% uh at the night safari , yea , i 'm gon na show you now .
there is a show and you can-
after the show they 'll bring out some of the animals .
if you like to handle a snake .
well , that might be an opportunity for you .
% oh so , we 're allowed to handle the snakes ?
like-
% uh only the ones that come out with the keepers .
you-
we wo n't let you introduce snake enclosure .
% um but they 'll be able to find you after that .
okay .
okay , my boyfriend has a fear of snakes and % uh i like them .
so , % um and i want him with me .
i do n't think he wan na go with a , you know a pit full snakes .
that would , just would n't make sense .
% uh in the zoo that i showed you just now ,
we have % uh reptile enclosure that you can go in .
but , i think you leave your boyfriend outside .
so you-
yah .
okay . yah , he can just watch from afar .
okay . yah , he can just watch from afar .
% uh you can see the giraffes here .
we just had a new baby born .
and-
that is cute .
so , here we have the % uh-
there is a tram ride and there 's also % uh walking trail .
so , if you walk fast and you are not too tired out ,
you can take the tram ride .
and after that , do the walking trail .
okay , just % uh maybe an hour if you walk slowly .
because you say you like animals ,
that would be fun , right ?
yah .
% uh do we get like some sort of % um % uh interaction like with the snakes ?
do we get interaction with any of the % uh safari animals ?
safari animals
like i said after the show , they bring them out and you can handle them ,
have your boyfriend take photos with you .
% uh the interaction in the daytime -
in the day zoo , so it 's when you go for , first with the orangutans .
and , that means you would go for the zoo visit for a whole day .
you would stay for morning till afternoon .
unless you take a break and journey to the bird park and comeback for the night safari .
because at the breakfast time , you have your breakfast ,
the orangutans have their breakfast ,
and then % uh can go up and take photos with the orangutans .
% oh i see % uh .
that would , yah that sounds like a good plan .
like % um so we fill up the whole day and do n't have to waste any of it .
% uh on the other hand , % um during the showtime also at the zoo .
you can opt to buy food and feed the animals .
, where can we buy the food for the animals ?
% eh % uh in the same place ?
the-
the keepers will be there with the food .
so , it is actually managed by the keepers .
so , they want to keep it under control .
they ca n't actually take out the cookies and feed the animals .
% oh yah .
% oh no , that wo n't make-
that we might bring in something that they should n't be eating .
yah .
that 's right .
so , do you want to know the ticket prices ?
% oh , yes please .
% uh wait .
let me show you the opening hours and the rates % um .
so , night safari .
this is the leopard cat .
you are only allowed in after dark .
those are anteaters .
they are really beautiful .
can you see seven-thirty to twelve ?
why is it the night safari and not the daytime safari ?
so , you-
is there a reason ?
% uh beca-
the daytime is what we called the singapore zoo .
and so , there is a price saving .
can you see here thirty-two dollars admission and tram ?
yap .
okay , so thirty-two singapore dollars for each person .
and includes-
% uh just a minute .
have a look at this chart here .
yah .
can you see at the bottom night safari and zoo ?
it 's only forty-two dollars .
so , you get a big discount .
yah .
that 'll , would be-
that 's not bad .
i would consider the package .
% uh so if you are visiting the bird park as well .
you 'll pay fifty-eight dollars .
and that same ticket you 'll visit all three attractions .
normally , you would have thirty days to use up the ticket .
so , in your two days for sure you would use it up within the thirty-day limit .
yah , i-
% oh okay .
so , this % uh-
this admission it 's only good for just one trip ,
and can i use all-
% uh do i have to use the ticket within the day itself ?
or can i use it on separate days ?
no , you can use it on separate days .
as long as it 's within thirty days of the time you buy it .
% oh i see .
so , the first visit whether it 's a bird park , zoo or night safari ,
you can buy this ticket .
% uh except if you are buying , you know bird park and night safari ,
of course you wo n't be at the zoo twice .
so , for the three-in-one at any of these parks ,
you buy the ticket and you make sure you keep the ticket .
so , they have the date on the ticket .
and they will tear off which ever portion they want for your visit .
okay .
% oh , alright .
okay , so that 's the system
yah , that 's the best deal .
it includes taxes .
% uh you are not a senior citizen ,
so you do n't get the-
no .
no , i wo n't
so , that 's about sixty dollars or fifty-eight dollars for both of you .
right ?
yes .
so , that would be a hundred and twenty dollars .
correct ?
pretty cool .
yah , it 's not bad-
it 's not bad of a deal .
so , i go for that .
and you 've on~
you 've only spend three hundred dollars of your thousand dollars .
wow .
so , i can spend the rest on food .
and then % uh there 's also % uh transportation to cover .
% um pu~
can you show me like % uh other shopping areas that are % uh close-
shopping areas .
okay .
shopping areas .
yes .
the best places to shop .
okay , just a moment .
you have a lot of money .
so , we are sending you to the % uh centre of the shopping area called orchard road .
i heard about that .
it 's just-
it 's like a really long street right ?
it 's a long street , but it 's very walkable .
because % uh it 's now connected by underpasses ,
where we have shops even in the other pass .
so , you move from a place to place ,
and % uh where it 's exposed is just a little area .
so , it 's not very hot even if you walk .
wow .
it 's the first time i ever heard of an underpass in singapore .
that's-
is that like a recent-
so-
% uh , no .
the underpasses , yes it 's quite recent .
and % uh we are trying to make it very comfortable for tourists to walk either on the road or underneath it .
so , that they can , you know do n't have to negotiate traffic light junctions .
and it 's a seamless travel from place to place .
so , here you 're seeing some of the scenes .
this is the little road off the main road .
we have bus and eating places alfresco .
behind there are also % um % uh restaurants in-
usually , besides alfresco you have also % um indoor dining areas .
so , you can shop and eat and shop and eat .
% uh you are looking at some of the high end brands here .
% uh , okay .
those upscale brands .
well , i 'm not much of the upscale person .
so i mean since i 've a lot of money and lots of gifts to buy .
% uh speaking more of % uh less upscale areas or shopping malls .
yes .
less upscale ?
okay .
% uh you are in chinatown .
so , i suggest you shop in chinatown for your gifts .
if you have to buy lots and lots of gifts .
chinatown would be the place .
% um % hm , okay .
and also little india .
and you can do a bit of bargaining , but usually the prices are very good .
just give me a moment to show you the street scene .
sure .
there 's a lot of street side shopping in chinatown ,
where you can buy off the stalls % uh that are in front of the shops .
and you can also go into the shops to buy .
they are very competitive .
so , prices are attractive .
they would hang out signs like any three items for ten singapore dollars .
or if you buy one , it 's two dollars .
if you buy three , it 's five dollars .
% oh , yah .
i 've heard about that .
% um the wholesale they called it .
last time i went to bangkok .
god , they were telling me like if you buy at least three items in the store ,
you get discounts .
yes .
% uh for us , it 's not like this .
it 's not a wholesale thing .
it is more % uh ap~
an offer to attract you to buy more than one item .
so , you get to % uh-
let 's say a fan and % uh chopsticks .
it might be a mixed things or it might be just fan .
so , if you buy one fan for instance maybe two dollars ,
so , they do n't consider themselves % uh wholesale .
it 's just % uh a gimmick .
you know , like the package for visiting the zoo , the bird park , and night safari ,
to encourage you to buy more .
because they know it 's within the budget of tourists .
yap .
yah .
i can see how that works and attracts people .
it attracts me as well .
so , sometime-
when i travel , i buy some of these things to giveaway to people .
so you give one of those friends % huh .
% uh % uh yes .
% uh when , you know it 's nice to give something to people when you are away also .
so , here something singapore .
alright .
yah , it 's customary .
like % uh if you buy those little % uh knick knacks .
like % uh little key chains .
i 'm not a big fan of key chains .
but more of things that if people can actually use .
yes .
you can get % uh fans .
that are printed with pretty flowers .
and you might want to bring one along .
so , that you can fan yourself as you are shopping .
and you can also get chopsticks .
% oh what about like % uh tea ?
like % uh do-
does % uh singapore offer like a variety of % uh tea and herbs ?
wel-
yes .
% uh we have the chinese medicinal shops that sell chinese herbs .
and they will even prescribe for you ,
if you have a particular ailment .
but , let 's have some of the shops first .
so , give me a moment .
we 'll try and get you pictures of some of the items in chinatown .
you can see % um broadly the street view .
can you see that ?
yap .
% oh it 's like-
so , this is the scene .
% oh so it 's like they have like little stalls set up with the umbrellas ,
and that 's where they % uh placed their merchandise .
yes .
it 's at the place called sago lane .
and it 's right next to a big buddhist temple called buddha tooth relic temple ,
which you can also visit if you wish .
% oh , okay .
so , that 's supposed to be % um near the hotel ?
% oh , yes .
it 's within walking distance .
maybe ten minutes if you walk slowly .
this part of chinatown is a little bit busier and has more traffic .
your side of , where your hotel is it 's quieter .
yah , okay .
i like the place then . so it's-
i like the place then . so it's-
as-
yap .
so , that 's % uh-
that 's nice because you can walk and see these things ,
but you can go back to the quiet peaceful part of your hotel .
wonderful .
% oh % um i like to add .
% um , because % uh earlier i mentioned that % uh we want to check out beaches if there are any .
so , % uh can you recommend like % uh place or if there is water park ?
yes , beaches .
i suggest you go to sentosa island .
you 're just interested in swimming , right ?
well , % um pretty much .
% um yah , just swimming .
and % oh % uh also a spa .
okay , spas .
there are in chinatown .
% uh you will be able to see them as you walked around .
and they might have offers for you .
% uh generally , they charge about ninety-eight dollars .
but sometimes they go for sixty-eight and even less than that .
% uh they give you offers .
so that you will sign up as a member .
but % uh as a tourist , maybe % uh-
no , these spas here % um more the upperscale ones .
i think the ones in chinatown are good .
you can also go again for what we called with foot reflexology .
% oh , i like those .
yes . so , every both days you can go .
yes . so , every both days you can go .
it 's not expensive .
it 's about maybe-
it depends on the time you take it from twenty to thirty dollars according to how long .
% uh , okay .
okay , let me show you beaches .
% oh that is sentosa island ?
yes .
and it -
% uh that is huge .
yes .
we have % uh universal studios there .
% uh and we 'll be have museums there .
two golf clubs there .
but the beach you see it 's nice and sandy .
there are beach umbrellas .
% oh that is-
that is nice .
you can also eat there .
there are-
there 's % uh inexpensive like a food court ,
where you have a variety of food .
where that you can order from .
how far is this from % uh chinatown ?
and of~
okay .
can i show you the map on the mrt on the print system ?
% eh , sure .
so , you have a better idea of where you are .
yap .
okay .
% uh when you come in from the airport and you at number three .
and i 'll come-
i 'll talk about the train system later .
yes .
you follow the green line .
and , it 's easier if you could take it all the way to outram park .
and then you switch to the northeast line .
okay .
so , it was from green at % uh outram park ,
and then the purple one to chinatown .
hey , that 's not bad .
that 's right .
and this stop is very near to your hotel .
wow .
wait , % uh do you know how many meters or how far and of a walking distance ?
% uh well , i count in time of minutes .
maybe ten minutes or so .
not bad .
okay , that still pretty close .
very close .
% uh the other way if you want to go to sentosa ,
you take the same line .
the purple line .
and you go just two stops to harbourfront .
and there are two ways you can go into sentosa .
you can cross the road and take a light trail ,
which is at the upper level of a big shopping centre .
but it 's more convenient to just take the bus shuttle in .
so , you walk from-
so , there 's a bus going from harbourfront to sentosa ?
yes .
you just have to walk a short distance when you come out of the train station .
you follow the signals to say that it goes to the bus terminals .
and just behind-
can you see behind harbourfront here on the right-hand side ?
it 's not shown , but there 's a big bus terminals .
and the sentosa shuttle occupies % uh two bus lots .
very near to the-
where you will be .
you just wait for the bus .
there will be someone there % uh to guide you .
and the bus will be marked sentosa .
so , you take it and it brings you straight in .
yah .
yap .
% oh okay .
so , is it the same bus % uh that will take me back to harbourfront ?
yes . on the island , the same bus .
yes . on the island , the same bus .
it runs a shuttle .
so , what you pay is just two dollars to enter the island .
and one dollar for the bus fare .
okay .
that 's not bad .
so , when you come out of the island , it 's free of charge .
in other words , they collect it when you enter .
and then they do n't collect anymore when you come out .
okay .
great .
i like travelling by train .
i ca n't really take taxis or walk , i mean too much or-
so , % um when we get to sentosa island , % um 'cause the place is huge right ?
like where wo~
like how far would the bus % uh stop from where , you know we 're supposed to go on the beach ?
% uh % hm that-
% oh when you reached the bus train in sentosa ,
i think the beach is quite near or you can-
if the beach is not near , you can just take a shuttle to near the beach .
they are internal shuttles within sentosa .
% uh let me have a look .
just hold on minute .
i have % uh brochure of it .
okay .
and sentosa island ,
% uh siloso beach .
there are three beaches along sentosa .
so-
yah , so i choose to one of them right ?
yes or could walk the whole distance from end to end .
and have a-
yah , if i have a lot of time .
when you reached sentosa .
yes .
% uh you can take shuttle buses .
so , can you see getting there the different coloured lines ?
yah .
blue , red and green .
so , % uh these are the buses that fly to different areas in sentosa .
% oh so they have their own bus in sentosa island then ?
so-
that 's right .
and there also a beach tram that you can take .
if you just want to have a fun ride on the beach tram ,
you wait for it .
it 's very popular .
okay .
well , % um so like do these beaches have like % uh theme park or water park ?
% uh there are-
like with the slides in the-
% um like an indoor surf pool or wave ?
this is actually the beach .
so , you 're on the beach .
you 're subject to the weather and the waves .
it 's very natural .
it 's not % uh an artificial environment .
okay .
so they do n't have that .
okay .
huh ?
if you want something exciting ,
% uh do you know how the ski on the water attached to lines ?
do you do things like that ?
yap .
% uh it 's like wakeboarding or % um water skiing ?
% uh water skiing .
it is along-
yah .
also that is something that's-
is that offered in the sentosa island as well ?
no , not in sentosa ,
it 's on the east coast of singapore .
% um i forgot the name .
% uh it's-
you have to be able to swim quite well .
% uh because the line brings you down into the water and you are held up by the line .
yah , let me see if i can get it on east coast parkway .
okay .
% uh there so much to do in the singapore .
this is what-
% oh if you want to wakeboard .
yap .
yah .
% uh we have a reservoir , it is called the % uh bedok .
there you go wakeboarding .
and this is a controlled environment .
it 's not the sea .
it 's a reservoir .
% oh okay . so , alright . % oh it 's a safe way that way , right ? so , there are n't any sharks that come out ?
% oh okay . so , alright . % oh it 's a safe way that way , right ? so , there are n't any sharks that come out ?
% oh okay . so , alright . % oh it 's a safe way that way , right ? so , there are n't any sharks that come out ?
% oh okay . so , alright . % oh it 's a safe way that way , right ? so , there are n't any sharks that come out ?
% uh we do n't have sharks in singapore .
% oh that 's a relief .
% uh do n't mind actually it will be fun .
we do n't see some-
we see dolphins occasionally .
but % uh yah it 's a little bit rare .
if you are on a boat ride out .
then you get to see % uh the dolphins .
% oh really ?
have you ever seen one ?
% uh yes , i have % uh of-
near to changi actually .
just for a second .
and it was a tourist who said to me ,
but he saw it .
so , it must have been real .
% oh , it's-
% oh so if you blink too fast , you will miss it .
that 's right .
% uh we get turtles landing on our beach occasionally .
% oh i love to see that .
i 've never seen turtles .
% um you ca n't really see it , because we find them accidentally .
and then , what happens is the public will inform underwater world ,
which is on sentosa .
it 's a lovely aquarium .
and-
% oh we have an aquarium ?
% oh can you show that to me ?
i did n't know there was an aquarium in sentosa .
you want to see the aquarium ?
yes , please .
% uh underwater world sentosa , okay .
so , is that separate from the % uh the singapore zoo that we saw earlier ?
the reserves .
yes , that is separate .
that would be on this island called sentosa ,
where you go to the beach .
so , you would cover this on the same day you go the beach .
% oh wow .
okay .
so , i can see where the beach is % um from that map .
and then-
okay .
can you see this ?
here instead of diving ,
or scuba diving ?
eh what happened to the picture ?
yah % uh i 'm trying to-
just give us a moment .
okay .
so , what happened is let me described it to you .
you see % uh marine fishes , which are very colorful .
the ones in the tropics .
yap .
yes .
and you 'll see them in-
displayed in % uh like an aquarium environment .
but you also get underground where there is a whole aquarium around you .
and , it 's like you are on display to the fishes .
like-
so , instead of like me being the % uh one watching the animals ,
they 're watching us .
yes , that 's right .
so , % uh th-
that 's a good way to put it .
you will stand on the travelator ,
and there are signboards at the side to show you .
you know , usually what 's animal-
% uh what species is there , they will display it .
and there 's also attached to this aquarium % uh dolphin show .
so , we have sharks .
you can even see baby sharks that are in the process of being % uh hatched , you know from the eggs .
wow .
in the show , you are seeing here ,
there 's a dolphin interacting .
yah .
% uh you will just pay a little fee ,
and it will get a little bit wet .
you do n't have to go all the way in .
but you can go down shake hands with the-
no , not suppose-
% oh that is cool .
i wan na try that .
you have to show me the prices or rates for those .
okay , % uh underwater world .
% uh this is if you dive .
okay , a hundred and twenty dollars if you actually bring your diving suit and dive .
and if you swim , a hundred and seventy .
% oh i would like the one with the % uh in the dolphin ,
swimming with the dolphins .
i do n't think i want to go near the sharks .
yes .
% uh no the sharks you do n't get to swim to do anything with them .
except see them behind glass .
% uh , okay .
% uh so that's-
that no .
it 's a very safe environment here in the singapore .
we do n't expose tourists to any risk .
and we think dolphins are pretty friendly .
% uh so , if you are prepared ,
then you need to bring your swimming costume .
okay .
yah .
that 's definitely i must .
yah and the-
and the package includes a t-shirt souvenir ,
and your boyfriend can take your photograph for you .
so , that 's good right ?
yah .
you have money left over .
if you are generous and you want the fish to % uh have a nibble at your feet .
can you see fish reflexology ?
yap .
you put your fish-
% uh put your feet .
sorry into % uh a very shallow % uh something like a pool ,
where they have tiny little fishes that nibble away at you-
the dead skin of your-
soles of your feet and all that .
% oh it 's like the fish spa .
the % um-
i think i 've seen that on tv somewhere .
have you tried it ?
yes , it's-
% uh i tried it .
it 's a little bit ticklish .
so , some people enjoy it .
some people find it a little bit too ticklish .
% um but it 's fun .
okay .
so , at least i know it 's not painful then .
pardon ?
at least i know it 's not painful .
% oh no .
it 's not painful at all .
and it 's % uh quite popular .
so , you sit around and you can all laughter at each other .
% uh because some fish will maybe prefer a certain foot more than the other 's .
so that would say a lot about that person 's feet .
yes % uh so % uh we do n't have much time .
% um do you have anything else you would like to ask ?
no i-
i 've pretty much seen everything i wanted to see .
so , yah i 'm then set on , you know going to singapore .
% uh % hm , that 's very good .
so , you can % um have shopping money and you can apportion some of it to % uh maybe a treat for yourself .
and then the rest to % uh souvenirs that you want to buy for friends to bring back .
yes definitely .
okay .
so , you 're comfortable taking the trains ,
you take the ez-link ticket from the basement of the airport .
you pay and deposit for the price you gon na spend .
and then you can get your refund before you leave singapore .
yap .
okay .
great .
alright .
so , thank you so much ms. jeanne
your welcome .
i hope i do see you in singapore .
yah i ho~
so , we can catch up and then % uh how we get-
go to % uh fish spa together .
fish spa , yes .
okay , right .
% uh maggie % uh nothing else to ask ?
yes .
no .
none so-
none , no more questions .
okay .
look forward to see you maggie then .
bye .
alright .
thank you ms. jeanne .
goodbye .
welcome .
bye .
okay .
yap .
do i ask about my time ?
it 's not really .
alright .
hello .
hello .
good afternoon .
i am jeanne .
guide number two .
hi jeanne .
good afternoon .
% um , i 'm participant number thirty .
my name is dodie victor .
% uh number thirteen .
how do you spell your name ?
is it d o d y ?
% um no .
that 's actually d as in delta , o oscar , d i e .
% oh d o d i e .
and your number three zero , is that right ?
that 's correct .
% uh % huh dodie .
how can i help you , dodie ?
alright .
hi .
so jeanne , i was actually looking forward to % um visit a country
in the southeast asian region .
and i 'm currently considering singapore .
% um , i wonder if you can help me out ?
yes , of course .
you need to-
first , you sound like a young man , are you ?
% um i 'm actually thirty four years old .
relatively young .
but i 'm not really that young .
yes .
very young .
% uh how many people will be travelling with you ?
% um , it 's just going to be me and my fiancée .
okay .
and your fiancé would be the same age as you , right ?
that 's correct .
okay .
% uh , when are you intending to travel ?
% um , we will be having a holiday week soon
in the philippines .
so i 'm looking forward to travel % um
first week of april .
that 's the easter weekend , right ?
% um that 's correct .
can you give me the exact dates
of arrival and departure ?
% hm , yes .
i 'm looking forward to leave manila
% um on thursday and so it most likely be thurs~
the same day .
and % um , i 'm thinking of staying at least a day or two .
okay .
% uh what are your interest ?
% um yah .
so yah that 's another good question .
% um , i 'm actually into sporting activities .
but i do n't mind going to places in singapore that are % um , already popular to a lot of tourists that go there .
so % um i 'd like to hear first what you have to say
% um about the destinations most people would like to go to .
% um and then i probably consider it % um or not if i think that it does n't fit my preferences
then i 'd let you know % uh if i can also visit some other activities
like a basketball game
% uh if there is something that will be done or happening on that same day that i 'll go there .
okay .
so you do~
you would like to watch a game in process % uh , while you are in singapore and also visit some attractions ,
is that right ?
that is correct .
yes .
okay , first % uh maybe we select a hotel for you
and % uh i show you a map of singapore
and so you know what 's the location
of % uh the various places .
okay .
so this is-
this should be the primary destination , right ?
for most tourists ?
yes .
this is % um-
when you come in from the airport -
i 'm sorry .
could you say that again ?
when you come in from the airport
you will land at changi airport
which is in the eastern side of singapore .
you know singapore is n't very large .
seven hundred square kilometres .
so , okay .
so this is a portion of the map that 's interesting that is enlarged .
% uh do you see number three here at the right-hand side ?
% uh that 's the eastern corner of singapore .
and the various colours you see are the lines for the mass rapid transit .
% uh so it shows you the connectivity .
so from changi airport if you follow the green line down and you end at outram park ,
you can go to the harbourfront which-
and it 's across from an island called sentosa , just opposite .
% uh and if you go the other way you are into chinatown
a little bit further up .
dhoby ghaut is a major interchange where you see three little circles .
so three lines pass through there .
and so if you take the northeast-
% uh sorry the north-south line , the red line ,
you will reach orchard road which is a major shopping and tourist belt .
alright .
right .
yah , i do .
okay .
right .
right .
these are all interesting spots however ,
% um i 've heard of sentosa before
% um and i 've heard from my friends who 've actually been to singapore and have been to sentosa
that it 's a relatively expensive place to be and the budget that i 'd like to allocate for this trip would about % uh a thousand singaporean dollars .
% uh sentosa % uh has got many attractions .
so you need not % uh use up a lot of money if you
for example see a show that's-
and you do n't buy the top end tickets
and in fact if you only go to the beach it will cost you only three dollars .
because there is no entry fee to the beach .
two dollars to go in , one dollar for the bus shuttle .
oh !
oh , interesting .
but whether on the island if you want to visit attractions then it's-
% uh whichever attraction you pick % uh it has a fee .
% hm , so what are the top % uh attractions in sentosa ?
okay .
first , % uh can i-
you want me to pick you a hotel first ?
oh ! % um , sure .
oh ! % um , sure .
but % um % uh since i 'm actually currently interested in sentosa .
so it there a hotel nearby ?
% uh , if you stay in chinatown , you can get to harbourfront and you can get to the island very quickly .
the hotels on the island would be a little bit pricier
because they are , you know , normal hotels % uh , on resort islands .
so % uh of the top of per head about two hundred over dollars .
in chinatown , you can get them for around a hundred or even less .
and you can also stay in the heritage area known as little india .
and if you come out of there
to eat breakfast , lunch or dinner or pick up a midnight snack
lots of such food in little india and chinatown .
% uh if you are at on sentosa , you probably have to go to the % uh restaurants along the beach or eat at the hotels .
so it will add to the cost .
right .
the-
wow .
okay .
yah .
so % um , yah , you mentioned that i have to stay in chinatown
get a hotel in there before i go to sentosa .
so is that something that i have to do by foot or do i actually have to reserve a vehicle for transportation ?
% uh you do n't really have to stay in chinatown .
i 'm just giving you choices .
so if you stay in chinatown ,
you 've got more money to spend elsewhere .
yah , that 's a good option for me .
so-
% hm , okay .
so back to our map here .
% uh when you land at changi airport ,
% uh at the basement is the train line % uh station .
and you go and see the officer and you buy what we call an ezlink card
% uh with a stored value
and you can get a refund on the unused portion when you leave .
so this would be a very fast and inexpensive way to get into town .
a lots of tourist use it .
s~
you would not be bringing a huge bag , right ?
so % uh you can-
% uh % hm okay .
% um , yes , it 's gon na be overnight .
so just a few clothes , shirts and pants .
yah , that 's right .
so you take the train
and the nice thing is it 's above ground .
so you 're getting a better view than if you are say in a taxi or , you know , walking .
anyway you would n't walk to town .
it 's a bit far .
it goes above ground right up to kallang and then it goes under ground .
so this mass rapid transit is partially above ground where there are space and partially underground .
so you take it down to outram park and then you can switch to the purple which is the northeast line .
can you see it ?
interesting .
yes .
and one-
i can see it .
yah , one stop you are in chinatown .
okay .
okay , so % um , i 'm not gon na miss it , right ?
% um , there are lots of signs % um that i can actually use as reference
if i need to get off somewhere .
will i have a guide ?
will i u~
actually use a bo-
mobile phone to contact someone ?
the-
no , you do n't need to .
% um the stations will have signs and there will be an announcement on the trains before you get off .
okay , good .
so you just , you know , prepare yourself when you are at tanjong pagar for instance .
and then at outram park , you get off-
you do n't get off the station ,
you just walk up or down another level .
walk down most probably .
and then you % uh switch to the purple line .
okay .
the line that connects to the-
to-
from the green to the-
to chinatown ,
is that another transportation or is that something i have to go by foot ?
no , it 's the same % uh system .
it 's just another name it 's % uh developed .
the green line was developed ,
first the green and the red line and this is an additional line that goes straight up northeast .
so it makes it convenient .
an~
so you stay within the station .
you 're just going to another level
and there will be many signs marked out .
there 'll also be people there willing to help you .
you can ask anybody around you .
they 'll be able to point you the way .
okay .
% uh do they speak as good as you ?
oh , they speak-
% uh depends on who speak you to .
% um if they can not understand you ,
they will give you a look-
a blank look .
and it could be a student from somewhere else or , you know .
% uh , someone whose not comfortable with english .
but i think by the third time you ask someone should be able to ask-
% uh answer you .
right .
okay .
'cause % uh are you familiar with the reality show % um amazing race ?
yes , amazing race .
% uh but % uh i don't-
is it on this weekend ?
do you know ?
because i do n't know the programme .
alright .
but have you seen % uh how they actually go about the competition ?
the game ?
yes , yes .
i 've seen it on tv .
but % uh they had a singapore sector .
but i miss that .
yah they did .
but % um % uh , you know ,
% um i 'm not very good when it comes to location or direction .
so % uh i 'm not gonn~
i 'm probably not gon na be a good fit for that game .
that 's what i 'm saying .
you need give me really good directions here .
otherwise , i get lost .
oh no-
% uh i am horrible with directions and i do n't have a problem .
you just % uh make sure that you are heading northeast .
so outside the train line
there are signs to tell you which direction .
you take the direction that goes towards punggol .
can you see number seven on the top right inside ?
because you are going northeast .
and then when you 're going to sentosa you 'll take the direction that says harbourfront .
okay .
yes .
okay .
% uh anyway , when you buy your ticket ,
you should be able to get a map from the airport .
% uh and if you need help from the officer ,
he will tell you .
anyway , since you mentioned it .
at % uh the right-hand side of the map % uh
can you see the green line ?
yes .
at tanah merah you need to get off and switch to go to town .
so this is where you go westwards .
yes .
so you just stand on the correct side of the station .
% um and % uh if you are not sure just ask anybody .
any of them who use that stop
they are the people who work at the airport and they will be able to advice you .
okay .
okay .
about the map that you mentioned ,
is that something that i have to pay for or is it part of the trip ?
no , it 's % uh usually given free .
and i think they have a large stock of it at the airport .
excellent .
okay , % um so we now have options .
% um can you tell me more about the hotels that i have lined up for me ?
% uh you mentioned little india , farrer park -
s~
so you want hotels in % uh chinatown , right ?
the cheap ones at least so i can enjoy the rest of my
allocated budget .
yes .
okay , i 'll get you the hotels in chinatown first in singapore and then if-
you see what sort of culture % uh would you prefer around where you stay ?
is it chinese culture or indian culture ?
% hm % um , i would prefer chinese
'cause % um i 'm part chinese too .
% ah okay .
but i like % uh the environment when people still have
% uh still can get aloud even if , you know , late in the evening .
you know , % um 'cause that 's how we are
me and my fiancée
we usually go out late at night just to % um grab a couple of drinks and % uh just dance to the music and stuff like that .
okay , so chinatown is the best location
because it 's near the singapore river where you can have althe-
al fresco dining if you do n't want to eat outside your hotel .
and you can see we have a list of hotels here that are not very expensive .
but % uh decent hotels also .
okay .
so there is one good one here .
just a minute .
we 're trying to catch it .
no problem .
okay .
oh !
% uh let me get the ones in chinatown .
so can you see a list of the prices there ?
yah , i can .
% uh if you want a quaint hotel % uh with nice design
hotel nineteen twenty-nine .
the building dates from nineteen twenty-nine and it 's in a quiet
-er part of the chinatown .
but it 's been completely refurbished .
all these hotels are-
there 's nothing murky or dirty about it
because it 's a conservation area .
wow .
since you mentioned it 's 1929 , % uh are n't there any apparitions in there ?
like ghosts or something .
% uh i 'm not sure .
if they did would probably % uh sell a ghost tour there .
no , not that i know of .
okay .
'cause that 's one thing i would definitely like to try .
% uh the-
you want to stay in a ghost hotel ?
a haunted place , yah .
i just wan na to try it out .
it 's a strange thing .
oh you are strange .
okay % uh later-
you can go and do shopping % uh at the street
where people used to wait to die .
% uh it 's called sago lane at the other end of chinatown .
but it 's about ten minutes away .
okay .
% uh the other hotel if you want to save money ,
can you see the top hotel
here ?
yes .
keong saik ?
keong saik , yes .
that 's on the same street and % uh i must tell you that
this used to be a red-light district
in my grandfather 's time .
but it 's all been cleaned up and % uh if you do n't want to have too much-
% uh to many people around your hotel ,
this is the quieter side of chinatown .
so , you want me to show you this hotel ?
yah , sure of course .
okay .
a picture would be nice .
so you 've been in this hotel obviously , right ?
i 've been in this area-
i 've been in nineteen twenty-nine which invited
travel agents and people in the-
tour business to visit .
but i have n't been in this other one .
but i think it looks okay .
from the outside of view % um actually % um gotten feedback from people who actually go inside ?
% uh no i have n't .
% uh but % uh you can see if there are any % uh ratings on the hotel .
% um % hm , yah .
that would be very helpful .
% um one more thing , is % um this area
you mentioned that keong saik and % um , nineteen twenty-nine
is on the or are-
they are on the same street , right ?
% uh huh .
yes , on the same street .
yes .
so % um is this part of chinatown 's safe ?
yes , it 's very safe .
% uh it 's very safe .
% uh you can walk out 'til midnight , you know .
you can find places to have % uh supper .
the shops around there might close around ten o'clock .
but if you want to have a drink ,
i would prefer you go down to the singapore river where the ambiance is % uh by the singapore river .
okay .
if you look at this % uh picture of the hotel ,
can you see the building up there ?
okay .
yes , i can .
and can you see additional remarks and notes ?
it won an architecture award in nineteen ninety-eight .
which means it was restored just about-
completely restored about four years ago .
and so it 's quite new .
% hm okay .
i do n't know ghosts % uh
previous occupants .
yah % um it will be nice if i could experience that there .
but i do n't mind , i do n't mind if it does n't .
so % um i 'm considering either this one or nineteen twenty-nine .
% um based on your stay in nineteen twenty-nine and % um the-
just the look of this hotel from the outside ,
which do you think is % um , aesthetically better ?
you know , better looking .
you may .
o~
% uh nineteen twenty-nine has a very good reputation
because the developer is % uh , you know , he develops small hotels .
so let me try and find you nineteen twenty-nine .
okay .
hotel nineteen twenty-nine -
oh , sorry .
so % um-
this hotel , i actually went inside .
% um % hm .
when did you last stay here ?
you mentio~
i did n't stay here .
i just visited it
when they had built it and they invited us from the travel industry to go in .
% uh what is interesting , i do n't know if this will % uh excite you
is that they have a room the best room is in fact % uh at the rooftop .
these are low-rise buildings .
about 3 stories .
but you see the rating here ?
is four stars .
oh okay .
right .
not bad .
pretty good , huh ?
and if you'd-
yah , huh .
if you take that room ,
you can have a shower in the open
% uh with just , you know , like palm trees and plants % uh just all around you .
% uh the hotel owner and the staff tell us they have done a check
and nobody from the nearby skyscraper , % uh business buildings can actually see you .
i 'm not so sure about that .
i would n't risk it .
you do n't want to risk it .
i thought you 'd not scared of ghosts .
you would not be afraid of this .
well ghosts are different .
% uh i do n't wan na expose my body to the other people .
you are actually surrounded .
it 's just the top , you know what i mean ?
it 's just the roof it 's not there .
right .
but % uh how-
is n't it windy there , you know ?
% um it might actually affect the scene .
okay then .
then % uh you can just take the suites .
can you see the rooms there ?
yes , they are nice .
% uh the one i 'm talking about is the terrace suite .
you can-
terrace suite .
oh .
but-
you can take a-
does that one-
a junior-
% um % hm , sorry .
jeanne does that one , the terrace suite also have % um its own
toilet and bathroom inside the room ?
not necessarily outside , but inside .
yup .
i am not sure about that .
% uh i think they 'd purposely put the the bathroom outside .
% ah they did .
that 's supposed to be part of the thrill of staying in that room .
oh !
i find the room really nice % um honestly .
but i do n't like the fact that % uh it 's outside .
the bathroom is outside .
okay .
okay .
shall i show you the junior suite ?
yah .
% um i think the deluxe room is better
'cause the junior suite has % uh two beds .
first-
yes , the-
okay .
yes , the deluxe is a double bed .
yah this one .
this one is better .
it 's very pretty , is n't it ?
and you see you have your own wash basin here .
it 's like , you know , you are in your house .
% um % hm , okay .
so the fittings and everything are-
it 's listed under budget but it 's not really budget .
i would n't call it % uh budget .
% uh when they 've opened it was fully booked for many months .
% hm it 's a very popular on the internet .
okay .
alright .
so i think i 'm gon na pick this one .
this is % uh seems like a sensible choice .
so your location would be chinatown .
so this is % um nineteen twenty-nine .
hotel nineteen twenty-nine .
yes .
that 's right .
so we gon na get you the rates now .
and i 'm going to get the deluxe suite .
okay .
can you get it on the screen now ?
yap i can see it .
so this is double , right ?
and this is % uh for the entire year , right ?
yes .
so it 's two hundred and ninety dollars .
okay .
that 's fine .
they have-
they have not mentioned any surcharge for
easter weekend .
so it should be alri~
wait .
let 's have a look here .
peak period surcharge will be applied % uh ,
must be done in seven days ,
cancellation seven days prior to check-in .
so there might be a small surcharge
because it 's the easter weekend .
right .
% um so i 'm expecting some activities , right ?
% um , activities at the museum .
a lot of free activities you can enjoy ,
% uh but % um we-
for here , for singapore , easter is mainly a religious festival and a public holiday .
okay .
so it 's very solemn ?
% uh yes it 's solemn .
but you can visit for example-
% uh are you catholic ?
yes , i am .
so you can visit the catholic churches % uh for mass .
yah , that would be nice .
% um which is the closest one or probably the nicest % um church in this area here ?
there are several churches in singapore .
% um , from where you are there are several catholic churches .
okay .
and the ones that many people go to is the cathedral of the good shepherd
okay .
and since you are there , you can also walk around and visit other churches ,
% uh within the area .
alright .
so let me get it for you .
so we 're going to fly over there
% uh on thursday .
% um will there be any churches open % uh until friday ?
the churches will be open .
% um , if the church is shut because there is no service ,
% uh you just go to the back , you know , where the priest lives and if you tell them you are tourist
they might even bring you on a tour around the place .
okay .
oh that 'll be great .
are there-
are they always accommodating ?
yes .
% uh , at the cathedral here , we even have lunch time masses
for people who go for daily mass during the lunch hour .
so this is a national monument and it is ones-
just a few stops from % uh your hotel .
from chinatown .
okay .
% um cathedral of good shepherd .
yes .
how long has it been % um up ?
% uh can you see here eighteen thirty-two ?
but of course it has been % uh repaired and % uh upgraded many times .
% uh many of the foreign community in singapore
% uh they come here because of its good location .
and you can see we even have a korean chaplin .
and we have many filipinas who help with the choir or , you know , with % um , collecting donations for the poor .
% uh , you see on the fourth sunday , we have a tagalog mass .
okay .
interesting .
okay .
so % um that seems like a very good % um time to go to church .
but that 's a sunday , however .
% um we 're only going to stay there 'til friday .
yes .
% uh for easter fo~
% uh you are staying for good friday , are you ?
yah .
is it good friday ?
that 's right .
yah , you can visit the churches in the daytime .
it 's not a problem .
okay .
and in this vicinity , we also have other churches .
let me try and get for you .
there 's the saint joseph 's church .
okay .
% uh i hope you do n't mind jeanne ,
but % uh are you also catholic ?
yes , i am catholic .
okay .
actually i was going to introduce you to my church
% uh because i have a filipino choir .
but they sing on saturday .
so , you wo n't get to see them .
okay .
saint joseph 's church , let me see , huh ?
you are also into singing then ?
yes , % uh but i just , you know , back them up .
the filipinos do all the major singing .
all the solos .
many of our choirs , we have a large proportion of the filipino community in singapore
that support the choirs .
alright .
yah .
a lot of filipinos are very % um-
they are so into singing .
so ,
every opportunity they get , they sing .
yes .
yes , okay .
can you see this one ?
yes , it 's nice .
this is very pretty and it 's within walking distance of the cathedral .
okay .
% uh and here we 've got many statues inside and the way of the cross % uh along the walls .
% uh this church served to the eurasian community .
this is nicer .
and-
yes , this is prettier % uh and it 's an earlier church .
it was set-up by the portuguese mission that came
but % uh after that the french mission took over % uh building of the churches .
so this is saint joseph ?
yes .
and % uh there 's another one called saints peter and paul
which is three minutes away from there .
all of these are national monuments .
they are protected .
so they will be here even if you come back fifty years later .
wow , i definitely would try that .
okay , let me see .
oh i should put in singapore .
let me see whether i get-
saints peter and paul in singapore .
so how do you feel about people would like to visit churches and then go drinking
the night after ?
oh it 's not a problem .
the filipino choir do it all the time .
yah .
% uh , we often have get togethers and % uh somebody will donate some drinks for the party .
because % uh we take public transport ,
so they do n't have to worry about % uh , you know , driving after drinking .
okay .
so these churches i 'm showing you ,
they are within walking distance .
all three of them .
oh this is also nice .
yes , very pretty .
very pretty .
what is it called again ?
church of ?
saint-
saints peter and paul .
saint peter and paul , % hm , interesting .
so do they have a museum or some sort ?
seems like a big place .
% um , within this area we actually have the national museum .
okay .
good .
okay .
'cause that will be nice if % um after we actually look around or like % uh go to church ,
we 'd also want to see % um a little bit more .
so museums would be nice .
okay .
% uh national museum , you may even get free entry
because it 's a-
if it 's a public holiday .
if it 's good friday you are here-
% uh , you se-
you-
will you be here on good friday ?
yes , we will be there .
the public holiday .
okay .
this is about ten minutes from % uh the churches .
okay .
ten minutes walking ?
by walking ?
walki~
yes .
okay .
so the location of where the churches are and where the museum is ,
it 's a old historic area .
% uh you just cross a few streets .
can you see victoria street ?
yes .
yes .
so the churches are victo~
just pass victoria-
around victoria street , queen street .
you just cross these little roads and across the road
is the national museum .
% hm , i see it .
okay .
so it 's very convenient for you .
right .
% um , you mention that % um this would probably be-
i 'm looking at the same timeline .
% uh we probably would go to the church in the morning ,
we probably stay there until noon .
so noon where do we have-
where we could have lunch ?
a really nice place for lunch .
% uh if-
there are lots of places you can eat around there .
% um , you could go to raffles -
what 's the food are you looking for ?
oh good question .
% um , let me see .
% uh , i 'm actually very conservative .
% um , i do n't really like a lot of junk food
but if i do n't have any other choice , i take any of the fast food chains .
but % um i do n't mind trying new things .
so-
so % uh if you want to try new things without spending a lot of money ,
there is a food court just near to where the churches are .
and it 's along bras basah road .
% uh , i can not quite remember the name .
% uh the food court .
let me see if it 's called the republic foodcourt .
it 's a chain be-
these food courts , they are chains .
just give us a moment .
yah .
% hm no problem .
go ahead .
take your time .
okay , let me see .
no , the-
it is not % uh republic .
it 's probably another one .
okay .
i 'm gon na try % uh , this other name .
it 's in the same area , right ?
yes , it 's in the same area .
and what kind of food do they offer there ?
% uh there you get a variety and you can see % uh ,
whether the food is suitable to you .
okay , can you see this ?
yes , i can .
okay , the first one item on the list-
is that pronounced as kofu ?
yah koufu .
it 's a chinese word .
yah .
it 's a chinese term .
kofu ?
okay , do you know what-
and-
do you know what it means , kofu ?
something to do with the mouth .
okay .
kou % uh is a mouth .
okay .
% uh at the fu , if it 's the correct fu is means
the good luck of the mouth .
that means you are eating good food or delicious food at good prices .
i 'm just interpreting it .
i-
they have a story about it but i do n't remember exactly .
okay .
okay .
i believe you , do n't worry .
okay .
so there you have it the explanation .
so you can tell if i 'm telling a lie .
% uh , yah , good fortune .
'cause i remember is it really good fortune ?
feast on good food .
yes .
good fortune to feast on good food .
alright .
so on the left what you are seeing is what we have for breakfast ,
a bun , two eggs , coffee or tea .
and then you can have % uh-
you know dimsum ?
yes , i do .
i love it .
yah dimsum is to touch the heart and you can try-
there is a stall that sells % uh , variety of food .
but at the food court it 's interesting this one
you know where the cathedral is that i recommended that you visit ?
% uh is just opposite the cathedral .
oh good .
% uh we have a university it 's called the smu and this is-
this branch is at the basement of the smu .
oh cool .
is-
so you do n't have to be a university student to eat there .
i often eat there
because the prices are reasonable and we even have
the vietnamese stall , we have an indian stall % uh and we have a lots of chinese food .
okay .
there you go .
% uh i 'm definitely gon na try chinese .
but % um i 've tried a few indian food as well but % um
what 's the other ?
chi~
vietnamese .
vietnamese .
i 'm not sure if i tried that one ,
but % uh i definitely will .
they % uh-
the vietnamese do a very good rice roll , spring roll .
% um okay .
you know if you are into healthy foods ,
spring roll that is not fried
but they use a special rice roll .
the roll-
the wrapper is made of rice .
and so they have a lot of greens inside that , it 's very healthy .
is it something like a maki ?
% uh no , it 's not .
it 's like a spring roll except it does n't have a crispy exterior .
okay .
you know we believe that if you all eat all this fried foods , you get a sore throat ?
yah .
so when you think you are feeling % uh too much of the sun and you might get a sore throat ,
then you go for this kind of food .
okay .
it 's easier on the throat .
right .
oh you mentioned earlier that the price is % uh reasonable .
% um i actually do n't mind spending on food .
if anything % uh in this trip , i do n't mind spending on food .
so % uh that 's something i 'm definitely gon na try and consider
% hm yes .
there are-
if you go to this food courts , you can try a whole variety of food without spending a lot of money .
alright .
so this place is good for % um let say lunch .
is it also good for dinner or % um
dessert ?
lunch .
% uh better for lunch .
lunch there will be more stalls open .
% uh dinner time , i suggest you go a bit earlier
because some stalls may close in the evening .
because the students would be there during the day time .
there is another food outlet that is % uh opposite this
a little bit further down the road towards the museum
but % uh opposite where this outlet is .
and that would be open late .
okay .
% uh , if you see-
can you see bras basah here
on the little map ?
yes .
so it 's along the same road is just stretching down a little bit .
% uh , and-
okay .
yah , that 's the same place , right ?
bras basah .
yes , it 's the same location .
alright .
so i see it .
so-
and so you could have your lunch at the smu .
i call it smu foodcourt
because i identify it with the university .
okay .
% uh , can you see bras basah road ?
yes .
% uh where the number a-
can you see the a there ?
yah , the letter a .
yah , you can see the koufu foodcourt ?
if you go for the up the road towards prinsep street .
% uh but on the opposite side of bras basah road there is another food court there .
i ca n't remember the name but it 's one of a chain in singapore and you also get variety of food there .
okay .
so if you do the museum and then you want to have dinner nearby conveniently ,
that 's the place to go .
awesome .
alright .
now , % um i think i already have my idea of places for-
when we get there , which hotel we 're gon na go , where-
which church we 're gon na visit , have lunch , and then go to the museum .
% um i 'm assuming this would probably end at around six or seven in the evening .
% um , wou~
which places would be % um a nice place to go to
if we are looking to have % um , a few drinks and % um a really nice place .
you know , with % um music and a little bit of scenery .
you know , views .
yes .
o~
okay .
% uh , quite near to here and you can walk if you like
or if you are too tired % uh you can take may be two bus stops away
is the singapore river .
so i 'm gon na suggest you go and walk along the river bank ,
you can have al fresco dining .
so i 'm trying to get it on the % uh screen for you .
okay .
what do you call that ?
al fresco dining ?
% uh that means you are sitting outside the restaurant .
% uh if it 's too hot , you can move-in .
they usually have seating inside and outside .
this is going to be % uh early evening , right ?
is it still hot at that time ?
yes .
% uh the sun is going down .
so it 's quite scenic .
% uh it depends on the day .
if it 's been a hot day ,
you will get % uh-
you might find it a bit warm .
and then later in the evening , you might find its nice .
maybe at nine o'clock or ten o'clock .
okay .
okay .
how about the music in this place ?
% um is it up-to-date with , you know , the current hits ?
hum .
i am not so up-to-date with music .
but , you can move along the various bars .
% uh some of them are sports bars that might interest you .
they have a big tv screen .
and if there is a match , like a football match , going on overseas
people sit there and have drinks and watch the match .
oh good .
okay .
% uh , you can start at boat quay and walk down towards clarke quay
or you can visit the merlion by the singapore river .
okay , so-
is that also another restaurant ?
no , the merlion is the emblem of singapore 's % uh tourism .
% uh the former emblem of the singapore tourism board .
it 's half lion head and half % uh fish
because we were a fishing village .
and a prince came along and thought he saw a lion .
so he asked-
actually he asked what it was
and he was told it 's a lion .
can you see it now ?
% uh it~
okay .
okay .
this is-
yah .
this is different from the sentosa lion , right ?
% uh , sentosa has a huge merlion about twelve stories high .
this is not so tall
but it 's a favourite place for you to take photographs .
it 's % uh most tourists on their first visit would go there and % uh , photograph it .
can you see it ?
it 's on the screen now .
yes .
so while you at facing boat quay if you walk left
you get to the merlion .
and so i think if it 's early enough , you might to want to
take a photograph of the merlion first
and then have your dinner along boat quay or clarke quay .
yah .
alright .
and-
these were good ones .
okay .
so definitely going to the merlion part .
yes , so it 's just one bus ride from , you know , the bras basah road i showed you just now where the food courts are ?
yah .
you take bus number one-three-one and you will reach there about fifteen or ten minutes .
% um , how much do we have to pay for the transportation for the bus ?
% uh , the bus fare would be under a dollar
for the two stops .
but remember , i said to buy a ezlink card .
yah .
right .
so you top it up-
maybe you put in more money and then you 'll get % uh bigger refunds .
so you do n't have to worry about topping up the value .
okay .
so short stops is under a dollar .
% uh longer stops may be up to a little over two dollars .
what do you think-
if you travel by train ,
it 's a bit more expensive .
what do you think is a reasonable amount i need to put in
the ez % uh card-
ezlink card .
% uh do you want to visit the zoo and the night safari ?
oh , yah .
i think that those would be good options too .
okay , i think you put in % uh maybe-
put aside another twenty dollars to top it up .
it 's twelve dollars to buy the card .
okay .
so twelve dollars to buy the card and ten more dollars for additional transportation expenses .
okay .
% hm , no .
twenty dollars , so about thirty .
twenty dollars , alright .
so that 's thirty-five dollars let 's say ,
give or take , right ?
but that 's more than enough .
you % uh-
it 's just so you do n't have to worry about
you know , % um-
% uh topping it up .
% uh if you go to a seven eleven store which is open round the clock ,
you would be able to top-up your card .
but if you put more , you save time .
yah .
right .
okay .
yah , i think i 'm gon na do that first .
i do n't wan na be hassled by % uh having to go to % um another place .
but % um yah i 'll store everything i need at least the maximum amount in the stored value-
% uh ezlink card
so i can just go around .
yes , that 's ri~
okay .
% uh then you can go the-
do you want to go to the zoo and the night safari ?
yah , that will be nice .
okay .
i 'll give you the website of wildlife reserves .
and i can show you pictures
of three % uh parks that is run by this % uh company .
and i suggest you buy a package ticket
so it is % uh cheaper for you for the entrance fees .
when you say package , how many people are supposed to be in there ?
oh , no .
the package is per person .
but , you can either choose to visit
two parks or three parks .
okay .
okay .
but whatever you choose if you buy separately ,
say you entered the zoo and then next day you enter the bird park and you 're buying individual tickets ,
you are paying more .
so if you decide where you want to go and then you % uh , buy the ticket on your first visit ,
then you hold on to the ticket and on the next-
at the next park you just present the same ticket .
great .
i 'm trying to organise my itinerary or % uh our itinerary here .
so , % um is it possible for me to actually pay for these in advance
so that when we actually get to the hotel ,
we would know % um what we need to do next ,
where were gon na stay at this time of the day
and then % uh when we can actually visit to wildlife reserve .
you know , is it something that 's possible ?
% uh wildlife reserves , i am not sure .
normally the tickets are sold at the door .
but if you want to pay for your hotel in advance , i 'm very sure they 're very happy to take your money .
you can give them your credit card number and they will send you an e-mail confirmation .
so , you-
at least for the hotel booking % uh which i think is very wise of you to book in advance .
yah .
% um % hm , yah .
but the wildlife reserves , the parks , % um this have to be done over the counter ?
yes .
unless you buy from a travel age~
and then-
hello !
you buying a whole-
hello !
yes ?
you still there ?
yes , i 'm here .
i 'm trying to get the pictures for you .
okay .
alright .
so see ?
we have a successful hornbill nesting % uh in the park .
and in fact we are releasing some of the hornbills into singapore
wow .
oh .
that 's nice .
here you see the % uh-
aviary ?
aviary ?
and this is king of the skies show .
% uh here you can volunteer to take part in the show without paying extra .
like how take part ?
% uh take part in the actual % um , show ?
like % um act it out or something ?
% uh i should n't tell you , i take away the fun .
% ah okay .
alright .
king of the skies they ask you to participate .
and % uh you just put up your hand and if they select you
then you go up there .
so there will be many people putting up their hands .
% uh so you may or may not be selected .
okay , 'cause-
i 'm not gon na get scared , am i ?
% uh not you i think .
% uh sometimes they do n't take very young children .
so the % uh trainers know what to do .
alright .
you can also % uh when you arrive get the % uh feeding time schedule .
and if you plan your visit to particular aviaries during feeding times ,
you can watch them being fed .
oh okay .
so in the african % uh aviary that you saw a minute ago ,
you can hold the bird seeds-
actually they are worms .
you hold them in your hand and the birds will come and take the worms off your hands .
okay .
% uh i was actually worried
that i might have to put the worms inside my mouth
and they eat it from my mouth .
no , then the birds will eat up your tongue .
yah .
i was of scared of that .
% uh but i 've seen it on tv before .
oh no .
% uh i think not in singapore .
no ?
let me try and get you % uh , okay , the zoo .
okay .
in the zoo , you have a variety of animals too ?
yes , and it 's an open zoo % uh next to a reservoir .
so it 's very scenic .
i think % uh you would love it for its photography .
wow .
% uh the only new things you see is this .
what is that ?
what is that ?
it's-
it 's a naked mole rat .
oh okay .
so it does n't have any hair .
i know .
it 's cute .
nudist colony .
bu~
i know you 're expecting something else .
okay .
% uh look .
can you see the great rift valley of ethiopia ?
can you see that on your screen ?
hello !
yes , i can .
so you see this % uh creatures here ?
we got them from ethiopia and we have set-up an environment
like they would live-in africa .
they are baboons .
yah .
yah baboons .
% um by the way % um since you 're showing me all of this
it reminds me of something .
do you actually have % um baboons running around-
excuse me .
the place-
% um the area .
% um the city , i mean . % um-
oh no .
% uh the only baboons are the human ones .
do you have any of that ?
oh no .
% uh these baboons -
that 's not very nice .
the-
% uh these baboons are-
they have been replica~
there have been very successful breeding there so-
so it 's a very large population .
and you are likely to see maybe a mother feeding a young .
% uh it's-
the enclosure is glass .
so you 're fully protected .
okay .
okay , that 's good .
'cause % uh i heard from my friends who actually visited india
that they see a lot of % um monkeys or baboons running around % uh
where they 're staying , you know ?
and it 's a city .
yes .
so-
oh yah .
it can be scary .
we have monkeys not baboons .
% uh monkeys that % uh that in the , you know , in the forest areas .
so we tell people not to feed them
because we feed them then they expect food .
right .
% uh you can eat with the orang-utans though .
can you see the middle one ?
the jungle breakfast with wildlife .
yah .
% uh you actually eat your own breakfast .
and the orang-utans at the back , the ones in brown
they have a sort of open area where they can swing around and play in the trees .
but during breakfast time they come down
and they have a buffet of fruits to eat .
and then after that you would be invited to take photographs with them .
% hm , if it is safe enough to actually eat in their presence
or do they try to steal your food ?
no they do n't like our kind of junk food .
they have better food .
okay .
they have fruits .
they are more health conscious .
they are , huh ?
okay .
okay .
and what s~
what 's the last one ?
okay , the last one is the % uh river saf~
% uh sorry .
the night safari .
there 's also a river safari , you can take inside the zoo
which is new .
but you might-
be running out of time .
so let me show you the night safari .
% uh i 'm not sure if this is one
but you know the giraffes that you see here ?
just had a baby giraffe born .
so it ' very interesting to see .
so we 'll be able to catch this ju~
new baby giraffe , right ?
i ca n't promise that .
% um the-
you will have to see the situation % uh when you get there
because they take care of the young % uh-
likely you can see because it will be with the mother
if they do not put it aside
% uh some place .
% uh you take a tram that looks a tiger at the back .
and you can see the-
you can see these creatures in black and white ?
okay .
they are % uh malayan tapirs .
and they quite tame , so they roam around
% uh the path of the trams .
they try and give way , but sometimes they forget the traffic rules .
alright .
but % um you mentioned they 're tame , right ?
yes , they are very tame .
but , you know , they wo n't listen to you if you tell them to get out of the way .
so if you 're on the tram ride and they are there ,
% uh it 's nicer .
because when you wait , then you have a chance to see better .
yah % uh you 're right .
you 're probably right .
but % um this is done in-
at night .
so % um are we actually gon na be given
% um night vision goggles or something ?
or do we-
is the place well lit ?
at night .
% uh , you can get in earlier to have your dinner .
so i 'm suggesting you go to the zoo in the afternoon .
okay .
and walk across their carpark to the night safari .
have a meal before the actual entrance to the park opens at seven thirty .
because that 's when we get night time .
% uh the keepers will put food near to where the lights are .
and that would be in an area where-
as you are on the tram , you can get a very good view of them .
okay .
so you will be able to see them .
so you can not use your camera .
% uh firstly it disturbs the animals and then second you also disturb the other people on the tram ride .
so they do n't allow photography , % uh-
oh , good thing you mention .
i was actually thinking of bringing my camera .
you can bring your camera ,
because in the outside area where there are no animals
many people take photographs .
right .
but % uh in the areas where there are animals ,
we 're not allowed to , right ?
no , you ca n't
because you spook the animals .
right .
that 's right .
okay good .
good tip .
and-
% uh you can see this show ,
the creatures of the night show .
what is that thing hanging ?
it 's re-
yes .
% uh it 's somebody who 's walking on a rope just above your heads .
so % uh again i 'm not gon na tell you .
you have to visit the zoo .
okay .
% uh actually i forget .
i forget what it is .
% uh , but you know , when you go there if you do n't want-
you 're not comfortable with the animals right above your head ,
you just avoid the-
overhanging % uh rope and you just go little bit further back
and you can see it as it goes along .
okay .
interesting .
okay .
so it seems i have everything from this first day of our stay in singapore .
how about the second day , i think i 'd still have a few hours
% uh before our trip back to manila .
okay , wait .
le~
% uh are you interested in the ticketing prices for this ?
% um yes , definitely .
first .
okay .
i 'd like to know that .
okay .
there you seeing some of the animals .
this is in the night safari .
these are beautiful ,
they are anteaters .
and antelopes .
% um okay so-
are we looking at the prices ?
yes , i 'm trying to get the prices for you .
wait , just a minute .
i thought you 're showing me more animals .
yah .
okay , sorry .
here it is .
there you go .
% uh , so if you 're visiting all three
you pay only fifty-eight dollars per person .
okay .
that seems reasonable .
you see up here ?
if you 're visiting only the night safari ,
it 's thirty-two dollars .
yah , i think i 'm gon na go for the three-in-one .
yes , that 's right .
so-
so there are two of us so that % uh it counts to hundred and sixteen dollars .
yes .
yap that still within % um our funds .
so , yah , i 'm good with this .
a hundred sixteen actually , right ?
it 's fifty-eight per person .
yah hundred sixteen dollars for both of us
% uh for this trip .
yes , that 's right % hm .
and that does n't include the meal , right ?
'cause % um you mentioned that
or you suggested that we go through % uh dinner first
and then go back for the night safari .
yah .
e~
% uh if you 're at the zoo ,
you can eat at the zoo .
there are places to eat .
% uh or you can walk over to the night safari and you can either have
a regular chinese meal or a buffet or you can have sandwiches , % uh burgers .
they have something called the bongo burger which is the name of an animal .
but there 's no bongo meat in it .
you just get a chicken or i think may be % uh fish .
i 'm not sure if it 's available .
but it 's just normal meat .
so do n't worry about eating wild animals there .
okay .
alright .
i 'm not really worried .
% um i 'm just conservative when it comes to % um eating junk food versus eating healthy food .
so i prefer , you know , variety of healthy stuff .
but yah i think i have everything i need .
thank you very much jeanne .
you 've been very helpful .
% hm it is-
okay , you 're most welcome .
i hope to see you in singapore , dodie .
yes , definitely .
i 'm definitely % um try to see you there .
well thank you very much .
i had a great time .
thank you for helping me .
thank you .
nice talking to you .
bye .
alright .
bye .
bye .
hi , good afternoon .
this is tour guide-
my name is lynnette and who am i speaking to ?
hi , this is participant number thirty one .
and my name is aaki , that 's double a k i .
okay .
hi aaki .
hello miss lynnette .
and how may i-
okay , i 'm fine .
and how may i help you today ?
how are you doing ?
well % um i 'm planning to bi~ visit singapore in the near future .
well i do n't have the specific date as of the moment but i really-
but i 'm planning of visiting the country .
and if i 'm not mistaken you 're a great and good tourist guide .
so can you help me with this tour ?
sure .
if you are talking about this % uh year ,
% uh we have a period of time that coming up really soon
end of may and december , because-
then we have this great singapore sale .
so almost all the shops in singapore are having good discounts % uh for their shopping .
so that maybe one time that you 'd like to consider ?
the other period of time where we do have big celebration in singapore would be % uh hari raya % uh puasa .
so one month before % uh the date in august % uh we do light up the street in kampong glam as well as geylang serai .
% uh and you will find a lot of food that specially prepared to welcome hari raya puasa
% um being % uh on sale at these two location .
so that is one other % uh month that you want to consider coming to singapore .
the other month would be in november
and that 's where the indians get to celebrate deepavali
and we light up serangoon road .
so % uh these ro-
few roads that i mentioned % uh will gives you very good % uh photo opportunities
because the streets are beautifully decorated % uh to remember or to celebrate these special days .
and of course in december we light up the whole street of orchard road right up to the marina area
and again with a christmas theme .
so different months for you to choose .
so again depending on % uh what would you like and whether it fits into your schedule .
so % um most of these months is perfectly fine to come to singapore .
but if you ca n't fit in your schedule in those months then you can always % uh do it any other time % uh that you like .
okay .
okay .
% uh % hm well , it sounded like your country is a busy country there .
but % uh let me just clarify this , what do you mean by hari raya ?
what is that supposed to mean ?
okay , yah .
okay .
hari raya is a festival that celebrated by the malays here .
% um now in-
% uh before hari raya the muslims would do % um a puasa that means they do not eat from % uh-
yes , from % uh early morning % uh from dawn to dusk , alright .
so % uh after the % uh evening period that 's they can eat until day break again .
so after this % uh month of fasting or we called it puasa
% uh the muslim will celebrate with this major festival called hari raya .
so-
% uh , so that is for the muslim itself .
yes .
% ah okay .
% uh malay .
yah .
so these are festivals celebrated by the malay people .
so in order to celebrate this festival they will dress up their houses , clean up their houses .
not that they do n't clean the houses
but they do very thorough cleaning of their houses as well as-
% uh prepare their house for a visits by their relatives and friends .
so they would buy a food like for example special cookies that they may not eat for the rest of the year
but specially made for the hari raya
so that their friends % uh and relatives when they visit them can get to taste all the % um yummy cookies and food .
okay .
% um yah .
well that 's cool but-
% uh yah , sorry about that .
but that 's cool to know .
% uh but do they have any kind of a special cuisine or-
in that festival are they allowed to eat ?
yes .
the % uh muslims will only do fasting before hari raya puasa , alright .
now once the-
they have % uh completed their one month fasting , % uh they will celebrate hari raya .
yes , and of course they do % uh eat their normal meals .
and i 'm not saying that they do n't eat during the fasting season
i 'm just saying that from day break to dusk they do not eat or drink .
but after they break their fast , everyday % uh in the evening
usually at about seven plus in the evening .
% uh five plus , seven plus depending on the % uh moon % uh they will be able to eat .
and once day break they will % uh start to fast their fast again .
okay .
% oh okay .
and so if that celebration is celebrated during october , right ?
% uh august .
% uh august
sorry .
thank you for that .
did-
that celebration is for august so meaning to say that is a general or a public holiday in singapore , correct ?
yes .
yes , the hari raya puasa is a public holiday in singapore .
% uh % hm so it 's a non-working holidays for you all guys .
% uh no , for the guides will be business as usual .
% uh okay , business as usual .
okay that 's good .
but % uh you did-
you told me something about the indians in november ?
okay .
in november the % uh indians another race in singapore will be celebrating a major festival called deepavali
and this is a festival of light .
% um again , same thing before the preparations for this festivals % uh the indians do not fast .
alright , they do n't have like % uh a fixed time for fasting .
so % uh they will start to prepare for this big celebration % uh by yearly thoroughly cleaning their houses ,
% uh making new curtains , making new cushions ,
buying new clothes for everyone to wear
and of course again food plays a very important part in all our festivals .
so again preparing food % uh sweets % uh for their guests to enjoy
when their guests , friends and relatives visit them during % uh the deepavali season .
% um % hm the-
which is the festival of light .
and you just told me that they are preparing some-
or they are buying some new clothes , right ?
are-
% uh is that for a costume or something like that ?
well % uh the traditional clothes for the indians-
because the indians come from the southern part of singapore .
% uh yes , so the southern indians would be wearing % um % uh sari .
alright , with-
it 's a piece of cloth five point five metre without any zips or button
% uh and it 's a matter of folding the cloth .
% uh it can come in any kind of materials from cotton right up to silk
and the ladies would wear them with a short blouse .
so that would be the traditional costume for the south indian ladies .
but % uh a lot of the ladies here they do wear-
the north indian ladies they wear this % uh salwar kameez
which is % uh consist of a long blouse and long pants % uh with a scarf .
so-
yes , that is also a traditional kind of a costume .
% uh but-
yes , it is still % uh a normal every day kind of a dressing for our malay la~
% uh for our indian ladies here .
% uh but otherwise , most of the other time i would think that because of the % uh western-
% uh modern influences
well the indian ladies today would also be wearing the normal kind of % uh clothes that any other lady in the world would be wearing
alright , the modern kind of dressing .
okay .
% oh , so-
% oh that 's good .
and how about the-
you-
how about the sari ?
the-
yah the sari .
you just told me about the sari
what kind of cloth is that ?
i mean is that for the head
i mean for the whole body ?
what does it can do ?
okay .
for the sari it 's actually a piece of material that is five point five metre long , alright .
% oh so that is for the male indians ?
% uh no , it 's for the ladies .
% oh it 's for the ladies .
sorry i 'm kind of mixed here .
and can you-
the people-
or in the indian the people have lot of-
% uh what do you call this ?
dresses .
sorry ?
will that-
costumes .
no , you are talking about sari , right ?
yes sari .
okay , sari is % uh worn % uh by the ladies .
the guys-
and how about for the boys ?
okay .
the guys will be wearing % um quite similar to what the % uh malay guys are wearing .
it will be % uh like a blo~
% uh a shirt with % uh long pants
okay long pants .
is it possible that you can show me the image
and so that i could really get the idea of the dresses the womens are wearing
and for the boys also if that is okay ?
okay .
sure no problem .
okay let me just-
and-
yes ?
% uh okay .
so miss lynnette , so as of the moment since i-
if i 'm not mistaken you are searching for sari looks right ?
yes .
okay .
so-
how about for the december you-
you told me just a-
is there a kind of park there is the marina bay ?
% uh park ?
no park
as in an amusement park for everybody
where in lovers and-
you know , family can get together to celebrate the fun of christmas
% oh yes % uh-
okay now-
yes the image for the sari
this is quite a modern % uh-
yah version of the sari .
you can see now on the screen .
okay , let me just go-
the % uh-
it 's okay do n't worry .
okay .
yes .
you can see all these beautiful ladies wearing the traditional sari , alright .
and that 's one-
okay .
yes i see that one now .
% hm so they look very beautiful , right ?
yes
and the model is very beautiful too .
very colourful .
yah very colourful sari .
it 's a piece of % uh cloth like i mentioned
% uh there is no ti-
% uh and there 's no zip or buttons on the sari
the bottom part the skirt .
so it 's a matter of wrapping uh around the waist .
yah , and the ladies-
so it 's just wrapping .
it 's like wrapping , okay .
yah .
and the ladies wear them with a short % uh blouse .
yes so you see % um this-
so did they use that for celebration of-
for the deepavali ?
% uh sorry ?
they use that clothes for the celebration of deepavali , right ?
% uh well i would n't say they use these clothes
but if you 're talking about the-
wearing a traditional costume
yes .
% uh quite a lot of our indian ladies today they would still try to wear traditional clothings
especially when it comes to % um % uh major festivals
% uh like % uh for example uh the deepavali .
yes they do try and wear % uh this kind of % uh costume .
well that 's great .
but i 'm really curious about this deepavali thing .
you just told me that it is a festival of light , right ?
yes .
so meaning to say they-
as in do they have a fireworks
or it 's like a showing of lights , different kind of lights ?
is that-
is-
how would you describe deepavali in-
like for an image , something like that ?
well % uh deepavali is actually called the festival of light
it 's because % uh the indians in their home they would like to light this % um incense
and % uh a candle % uh in this incense-
% uh candle holder
in their home .
and basically in short , it 's actually a festival to celebrate the triumph of good over evil .
% uh so this is all this festival is all about .
yes .
% oh , i see .
okay now i get the idea .
i thought they will just use the-
like firecrackers and stuff like that .
so meaning to say they are just gon na light their houses with candle
and scented candles , right ?
% uh up to the individual whether they want to use a scented or just a normal % uh kind of % uh candle .
alright .
% oh yah .
okay .
so how-
so let 's go back with the men dress for the deepavali .
let me see what they wear .
yes .
alright .
% uh it 's quite a simple clothing .
okay .
after-
so how do you call the men 's costume
or let 's say natural dress or normal dress for the men ?
% uh no % uh special % uh
well we can call it-
for indian .
special name ?
yah .
kurta .
kurta , k u r t a .
kurta .
kurta .
yah .
wow .
kurta .
kurta % um-
kurta .
yah .
% oh kurta .
how do you say-
kurta , right ?
kurta .
kurta , yah .
kurta .
yah .
% oh did i say it right , kurta ?
yah .
yay .
so most of the indian people or the indian guys ,
what they usually use for language ?
as in they are tamil or what ?
% uh for the indians in singapore
% uh well i would say that majority of them would be % uh third generation singaporeans already .
so % uh even i think in their own home they would be speaking english
but % uh a lot of the ancestors-
the indian ancestors would come from % uh southern part of india
% uh so yes they would be speaking tamil .
% oh so that is their mother tongue , right ?
yes , the mother tongue for the indians % uh in singapore generally % uh tamil
% uh unless they come from the northern part of singapore then they would be speaking hindi .
but incident-
wow .
yes .
okay .
sorry .
but inci~
sorry , go .
okay .
incidentally % uh tamil is one of our official languages out here in singapore .
% oh okay , so kurta .
so is there a kurta dress for the men ?
% uh we do n't say dress
% uh kurta is fine .
% ah okay .
yah .
% ah okay , kurta .
okay .
yah .
so they do have that kind of celebration for the deepavali like party at night
or something like eating festival ?
what do they usually do ?
% uh in just-
instead for just lighting the candles for their houses .
is there anything special ?
well % uh-
yes .
the indians would visit % uh their relatives and friends
and of course they get to % uh eat .
like i said the families would be busy cooking
% uh % uh to make sure when their friends and relatives come and visit
they would have food available for them .
so % um they will be cooking things like curry
different kind of % uh flavour of curry .
% uh eating this curry with rice
or with % um % uh bread like % uh chapatti
that 's made from wheat flour
or roti prata .
% uh may~
but it maybe a little bit difficult to make this at home
% uh or naan , alright .
naan is % uh of course the indian bread .
and the-
okay.2
okay .
% uh okay .
yah .
nice .
so these are % uh some of the foods that the indians % uh would be preparing .
% uh and of course a lot of homes they tends to make their own % uh so-called % uh sauces
% uh and we call them masalas .
so they can make from coconut
% uh they can make from beans , yellow beans , lentil .
% uh they can make them from % uh vegetables as well as spinach .
alright ?
so these are some of the dishes and food that the indians would prepare to welcome their friends and relative .
as to partying
yah i think some of the younger people ,
yes they may go out partying in the various clubs that we have in singapore .
% uh so-
but i think for deepavali the majority of the time they would like to spent time with their family
% uh and visiting one another .
% um hm .
% uh hm .
well that 's good .
and another thing i want to know since you 're talking about food
i want to know what would be the specialty or the special food that the indian people prepare for this deepavali celebration .
% uh okay .
i % uh mentioned that actually all the time they would be eating % uh a lot of this bread
like roti prata , chapatti , naan with curry .
so again this is one food that they will % uh be % uh having that
a lot of them also like to eat this food called % uh tandoori .
okay , i 'm gon na show you some % uh % uh show you a picture of this tandoori .
it is a chicken that is cooked with a spice , alright .
and a red colour % uh colouring .
so that is the tandoori .
yes .
yes .
is-
% oh is that rice ?
is that fried rice or java rice ?
% uh it can be a plain rice .
% uh i 'm talking about the chicken huh .
so th~
% uh the chicken .
yah .
so this is % uh usually it 's quite red in colour ,
the tandoori % uh chicken .
okay .
yah .
is that a special kind of chicken ?
% uh not special , it 's the way that it 's cooked
% uh that is special .
they put this chicken % um and cook them
in % uh this big % uh kind of a clay pot % uh .
so that is-
some seasoning like pepper and salt
something like that ?
% uh hm .
yah .
yes .
yes .
% uh okay , that 's good .
% uh okay , hold on .
i 'll get another recipe out here .
let see .
so most of the people there like celebrating the deepavali prepare those foods , right ?
yah .
yes .
% oh well that 's good .
then it 's kinda tasty .
i want to taste it now .
but if-
they do-
% um yah but-
you see-
% uh if they do not have time they can always buy them % uh from the hote~
% uh from the restaurants
or buy them from cafes .
% uh so these are just very i would say typical % uh indian dishes that indians would prepare
either at home or they buy them % uh from the % uh restaurant .
wow .
so-
now and the indians-
yes they do eat % uh a lot of this food .
they eat % uh basmati rice which is the longer kind of rice grain .
yah .
so they would be % uh eating this rather from-
% uh rather than rice that comes from thailand
alright , which is the shorter rice grain .
so this is the kind of % uh-
just some examples of % uh indian food that we have , okay .
and then of course % um a lot of families do prepare masalas .
% uh like i said those are sauces
and they come in like white colour , green colour , orange colour
because they are made from different kind of ingredients .
the yellow colour masalas would be made from beans .
yes .
wow , it 's kind-
well i 'm starving
i want to eat .
yes .
no just kidding .
so thank you very much for that information miss lynnette about the deepavali .
i gain so much information about that .
but let 's move on with the december occasion that you will be having .
what would that be again ?
yes .
% uh this will be the celebration for christmas .
well in singapore whatever races or % uh belief % uh that we come from
% uh everybody else i think celebrate christmas here in singapore
because the streets in orchard road % uh will be lighted up very beautifully .
so i 'm just going to show you % uh last year % uh the light up on orchard road .
okay .
okay .
okay .
so for example i 'm in singapore and i wanted to see that christmas celebration in orchard road ,
what would be the ideal transportation i would use ?
well you can walk .
wow .
really ?
from the airport ?
yah .
% uh no , not from the airport , alright ?
okay .
% uh what i meant by walking is
well you can stay anywhere in singapore .
so you just go the orchard road
and-
okay .
so is it-
orchard road is like the main city of singapore ?
or-
i would n't say the % uh main city .
% uh it is like the main % uh shopping belt in singapore .
so % uh now you have this image of last year ,
the whole street of orchard road is lighted up .
so that 's why i say you walk and you % um enjoy the lights
and lots of bus-
% uh photo opportunities .
alright , beautiful lightings
because every year the lights are % uh different .
the decorations on the buildings , on orchard road
because every other building on orchard road is either a hotel or a shopping complex .
so % uh they are also nicely decorated for christmas
so of course with-
wow .
wow .
% ah okay .
so that means everybody participates in this particular occasion ?
yes , that 's good that's-
if you mean participate by coming down to orchard road , do a little bit of shopping
and % uh soaking in the atmosphere
% uh and taking photograph then yes .
yes .
wow .
yah .
% uh that-
then that is participation .
wow , that 's great .
well that 's great .
i 'm happy .
i 'm really excited to see singapore this december if necessary .
yes it 's very pretty in the month of december .
what are the other events which is happening in december rather than in orchard road ?
% uh i mean do they have like musicality show
like party in the streets
or they do have drinking occasions , something like that ?
% uh yes , we do have .
% uh on the christmas day % uh christmas eve we-
what we do is you see now a lot of cars on the street ?
yes .
i am .
what we do is we close this street .
yes , i'm-
no way .
yes .
so and % uh-
yes we have a street party out here .
alright ?
inside just-
wow .
so up until what time ?
it starts from what time to-
till what time ?
eight p.m .
eight p.m .
eight p.m . until % uh twelve midnight .
% uh in fact we just close this street % uh just over the last weekend .
we had the fashion % uh step out % uh fashion .
so we have the longest runway , alright .
the models are modelling on the street .
okay so-
well something-
this is the first time that we are doing it fashion step out .
wow .
nice , that 's good .
okay , yah .
so what you mean is the orchard road is the busiest road or place in the singapore , am i correct ?
or just one particular place ?
% uh no .
orchard road is one % uh long street of shopping % uh opportunities .
% um so what do you mean by long ?
as in long .
how big this , how long ?
i mean what would be the square metres ?
no , i 'm just kidding
you mean-
so-
okay .
orchard road itself is about % uh three kilometres long .
so every other building would be a shopping mall or hotel .
wow .
wow
so that is the nice place to stay in .
what would be the-
what kind of hotels would i see in orchard road ?
i mean are there like three star hotel -
from three star to five star like that ?
in fact-
okay .
we do n't have % uh three star hotel in orchard road
we do have four star .
% uh just about ten minutes ' walk we have this hotel called elizabeth hotel .
elizabeth ?
yah .
it 's a small hotel .
okay , let me just show you .
how do it look like ?
% ah okay , thanks for that .
okay so if ever i go there in singapore i 'm gon na look for that
yah .
this is-
so what would ki-
what would be the-
let say what would be the ideal hotel for me to stay ?
let say for me to tour in singapore i only have one thousand singapore dollar
what would be the ideal hotel for me to stay in orchard road ?
okay , you can choose this hotel .
the rates wise for this hotel is approximately about two hundred and fifty dollars ,
this is one option .
% uh because you're-
if you 're going to just stay a short % uh stay in singapore % uh no problem , alright .
so you can stay in this hotel .
% uh the other hotel just next door to this hotel
is this hotel called york hotel .
because % uh i 'm just % uh choosing some hotels just very close to orchard road
since you know , i think you may decide to come in the month of % uh december .
so you know you just walk down to the are-
the street that is all lighted up ,
okay to visit york hotel .
the charges approximately % uh two hundred and eighty dollars per room per night .
so this is another option .
% uh otherwise you could stay in this hotel called grand park hotel city hall .
yes .
hotel .
% uh hm .
you could also choose to stay here as well .
yes .
so what would be the differences between these hotels
like the three hotels that you shown me ?
that you are showing me ?
differences as in location ?
differences like-
differences like amenities .
okay .
% uh all the three hotels they have full amenities
so they have breakfast available in the morning .
% uh they have % uh % um cafes in the hotel .
so if you do n't want to eat out you can always eat inside the hotel .
you could have room service as well in these three hotels .
now if you want a little bit more affordable
you can stay in this hotel called % um grand central .
okay .
that is also just a five minutes ' walk % uh from the % uh orchard belt area .
% uh okay .
that 's good to know .
% uh grand cen~
and for this grand central hotel like you are gon na show me as of this moment
what would be the events that is happening in that particular hotel ?
i mean do they show some like-
do they have a show for like comedy show or a theatre , something like that ?
because some-
if i 'm not mistaken some of these hotels have this particular event
like they have a concert and buffet , something like that .
do they have that kind of event ?
% uh no .
% uh for all our hotels we do n't have % uh shows in the hotel itself
because they do n't have % uh like concert theatre .
so if you want to attend any concerts ,
yes we do have big acts coming in to singapore .
% uh so again i have to-
i will have to check for you in december what are the big acts that 's coming to singapore .
% uh the only theatre we have in singapore would be at the esplanade .
% ah okay .
and how long is that from orchard road ?
well it 's just one station or two station away % uh from orchard road .
so it 's the esplanade , alright ?
a walk away ?
% uh this is our theatre so we can see % uh what are the acts that will be coming
what are the acts or musical that is in town % uh-
yes .
yes .
yah .
so we will have to check % uh for the month of december , okay .

yes .
and you just said station you mean do i have to ride a subway or mrt ?
yes , you would have to ride a mrt .
% uh okay , that 's the short way-
% uh subway to come to the esplanade theatre .
so this is one of the main theatres that we have .
% uh like i said % uh every month , every other week
we have % uh act that is % uh playing % uh in singapore
whether it 's a recital from classical right up to % uh rock singer , celebrity musical .

% uh so we basically have the whole calendar so we could check you know
like if you are planning to come in december

and then you could coincide your % uh arrival time with what you 're going to watch .
and you could always book % uh tickets online % uh for the acts that you want to see .

yah , so this is the labrador park out here .
of course there ' s a little bit of history .
you can see that-
and again the wedding couple taking photographs .
yah i can see that yah .
yah so this is
quite a romantic spot % uh for a proposal .
so , there are quite a fews % uh spots .
yes and this is the view of the night time sunset .
yah that 's great .
so , okay .
% uh i guess i 'd be going there .
okay , so this is-
i 'd be taking % uh-
okay , this is just one of the places that you can consider uh for a proposal .
okay and it 's not that crowded .
alright , in the evening there would be some people around , but uh like i said it 's not that crowded .
alright , it 's just % uh there will be just a bit-
a few people out there .
that 's good .
i guess you ca n't really find a place that is
that secluded anymore .
yah , but anyway it 's a safe place .
and with them a few people around .
% um ya i think that 's nice as well .
okay ?
so , this is % uh one of the location that you may want to consider .
% um otherwise , we have lots of other parks .
% uh somewhere this one nearer to the % uh botanical gardens .
okay , that sounds good .
but i was actually thinking of taking her to the mall before going to , you know the park .
so would the-
would a mall be close to % uh the park ?
sure % uh-
okay .
then i will propose-
okay , maybe you have to look at this botanical garden .
so , you can see there 's so many beautiful spots where you can do your proposal .
alright ?
it 's very % uh-
and it 's not crowded .
again because it 's big enough for you to choose your % uh favourite % uh place where she likes .
and you can now do the proposal out there .
okay , the more closest to the botanical gardens would be the tanglin mall .
okay .
so , besides that do we have any other options ?
% um , yes .
let me just show you the tanglin mall .
okay , this is the tanglin mall .
it 's just at the end of the orchard belt area .
and the botanical garden is just diagonally across .
so you can take her to this mall first .
but this is not % uh-
this mall is not as big as the other malls in singapore .
% uh okay .
i guess that 's okay .
since , you know i 'm going to propose and that would mean i would be % uh having to save money .
so , taking her to a big mall would be much more of a disadvantage for me .
so a small mall would do .
alright .
so , you just want to do with just % uh a quick spot of % uh shopping before you go to the gardens .
yah .
yah .
alright .
okay , so you could have a meal out there as well there are restaurants option % uh in the tanglin mall .
and like i 've said you just walked across-
diagonally across .
% uh that would be about ten minutes ' walk .
and you will be at the % uh main gate of the botanical gardens .
so , you can just walk and % uh have a nice stroll in the garden .
and the garden closes its door at twelve midnight .
twelve midnight ?
okay .
that sounds good .
so , let me see .
i 'm going to be planning my trip .
so , first i guess i would be going to the % uh botanical garden .
then , next i would be going to the mall .
then , next-
what was the name of the park ?
lab~
labrador park .
labrador .
okay .
yah so , you are % uh going to do your proposal in the botanical gardens .
well , actually no , i was thinking more % uh-
i guess i think like i 'm going to have to see the place first .
but most probably-
yah , i guess .
% uh looking at the pictures , i guess i would choose the botanical gardens .
alright .
now , from here you are actually down in orchard road .
% uh so again if you just walk % uh just the-
from the tanglin mall , you just walk down .
% uh you will come to orchard road .
% uh and over that way that is actually a shopping or-
% um hotel right next to one another .
so , this is actually one of the street scene along the orchard % uh-
or tanglin shopping centre area .
okay .
wow .
that looks good .
what is that christmas season ?
oh yah .
this photo was taken during the christmas season .
okay .
% uh yah .
but it 's a quite % uh old % uh photograph already .
okay .
yah .
too bad , i was n't able to go there at this past christmas .
so-
% uh you can make it here the next-
the coming christmas in december .
% uh , yah .
let 's see .
% um anyway are all these locations are close to my hotel .
is that correct ?
% uh well , it depends on where you want to stay .
% uh around this area because this is actually at the other end of the orchard road .
so , it-
there are few hotels here .
% um we have the traders hotel .
it 's just next door to this mall .
the tanglin-
yah , i mean if you are talking about you do n't want to walk too far .
there 's a traders hotel .
everything-
% uh actually-
and i do n't really mind doing the walk .
since , you know i 'm going to get to see the place a lot more .
so , even if i do like long walks just to get to the place .
that wo n't really be a problem .
as long as it does n't take me like thirty minutes or so .
you know .
nothing too far .
okay . i think this is quite a good choice % uh hotel .
okay . i think this is quite a good choice % uh hotel .
% um but like i said any other hotel along orchard road .
since this is going to be your proposal trip .
then , i will propose that % uh stay in a nicer hotel .
so , any other hotel on the street itself % uh would be a relatively % uh good hotel .
% um we have right smacked in the heart of % uh the orchard hotel .
we have % uh a relative new hotel by the name of % uh grand park orchard .
trip .
grand park orchard .
okay .
and do % uh we have images of that ?
yes .
let me just-
okay .
this is orchard grand park .
so , i 'm guessing sing~
again , please continue .
this is orchard grand park hotel .
and you 're right smack % uh you can see this is the map of orchard .
okay , this is one straight road .
% um the earlier hotels i proposed to you is on this side .
on the left-hand side .
and grand park will be right smacked in orchard road .
% um , okay .
okay .
wa~
yah that looks great .
so , it would just take me a few minutes to get to the park ?
% uh , yup .
it 's about % uh just a leisurely walk about twenty minutes and you 'll be in the park .
okay .
yah , okay .
so , that would be good .
bus .
alright .
and % uh you will be alighting at the fourth bus stop .
% uh bus number seventy-five .
okay .
so , i 'm guessing since % uh , you know % uh since i 'm a guy , and all .
i really do n't have a clue to what could be or should be romantic .
i 'm guessing since you 're suggesting these places .
you find them yourself % uh romantic .
% um , yes .
yes , i mean i think they are % uh suitable % uh for a couple-
% uh to have a nice time in singapore .
and % uh maybe you may want to do some % uh body massage in singapore .
okay .
okay .
well , yah .
that sounds good .
the spa , you know % uh in singapore .
so , we do have spa treatment .
% um myself i think i 'm okay .
but i guess i would be giving that to my girlfriend .
so-
yah , that sounds good .
good you-
good that you suggested it .
it never crossed my mind .
okay , so-
okay , these are just some of the option % uh that we have and-
well , there are nice places with very % uh relaxing spa in singapore .
for example , you can % uh do the one at raffles city .
% uh okay .
% uh this is in sentosa
sentosa .
okay .
that looks good .
yah .
it 's % uh one of our offshore % uh resort island .
but anyway , there are also nice spa on the mainland itself .
so , you can always have-
give her % uh a pamper , you know .
pamper her with % uh a spa treatment .
yah .
i guess i would be doing that .
% uh right after i proposed .
since it would be-
i guess we could say stressful day for % um-
of because of all the travelling we 'll be doing .
so-
yah , i guess i could be planning that on the second day .
okay .
so , not that she has to decide whether to marry you or not % eh .
okay , so-
yah , nearby to grand park -
yes grand park they do have this service as well .
% um otherwise , you can have your-
this % uh spa treatment in another hotel like for example hyatt
% uh fairmont hotel .
% uh they have all these % uh spa treatment
yah .
% uh hm .
but at traders hotel they do have spa treatment as well ?
% uh yes .
they can % uh provide this service .
okay .
that 's good .
i kinda like the images that you showed me a while ago regarding traders hotel .
alright .
and okay .
so , what i would be-
what i 'll be doing is-
okay , so i 'm going to propose during the night .
then , i 'm going to go to the spa just for her in case she needs some more time deciding .
then , what do you think would be the best next move in case , you know we get to finish early ?
% uh why do n't you do-
why do n't you give her the spa treatment in the afternoon ?
then , you could go to the garden .
so , your proposal in the night time .
and either you give her a nice dinner treat first % uh before the proposal .
that-
okay .
that sounds-
that actually sounds better than my plan .
so-
yah , we 'll be doing that .
so , spa first before the garden .
yah .
alright ?
okay .
so , what you can do is we have this % uh very interesting-
or i would say % uh dinner place in the botanical garden .
% uh which are then at the botanical gardens .
% um okay .
okay .
i 'm gon na show you some images .
then , you can have your dinner here .
and later just go for a stroll in the garden .
everything look so wonderful .
i 'm really having a hard time choosing .
yah .
so , you could do this option .
alright .
you can see .
wow .
this actually looks good .
it will be-
yah .
it will be western food in this % uh restaurant in a colonial house .
western food .
okay .
yah .
this is that your-
this % uh restaurant is built in the garden .
alright ?
so , % ah-
so , again very relaxing .
so , both of you will be in a relaxed mood .
% um enjoy a dinner in the garden .
and then go for a stroll .
you know , what really % um-
what i was thinking is like i real-
re~
i really would like her to experience singapore .
so , you know % uh me taking her to a dinner with western food .
that 's not really singapore .
that 's what i 'm thinking right now .
so , it-
i think % uh if the traders % uh hotel has singapore food there .
then , i guess i would be taking here there instead .
but unless you have any other like options for me to go to with singaporean food .
okay .
western food not really , you know-
i 'm going to singapore and i 'm going to be eating western food .
that's-
it 's kind of out of context .
okay .
sure .
no problem .
then in that case , you just get out of the traders hotel .
you just go % um next door to the shopping mall .
shopping mall .
any place more romantic ?
okay .
than a shopping mall .
then you have to % uh travel a little bit .
alright ?
% um you go this placed called dempsey .
that's-
that 's okay .
dempsey , okay .
sounds good .
okay .
now , this is just about-
it will be a little bit inconvenient-
% uh because there is no mrt ride that 's so close to the little hill up here .
% uh so , you may have to take a taxi .
alright , from % uh orchard road .
% uh it 's just about a ten minutes ' ride .
% uh that's-
% uh hm .
but-
but from orchard road , if we decide to like walk the distance towards dempsey .
would that be okay ?
i mean , you know .
okay .
from the traders hotel , you will walk about twenty-five minutes .
or-
twenty-five minutes .
okay .
that sounds-
yah .
if you want walk .
that's-
that sounds okay .
since we are going to be experiencing singapore while walking rights .
% um so there are quite a few dinner options out here .
% uh ranging from indian food to chinese food .
of course western again % um-
okay .
i 'm going with the singaporean food .
% uh a lots of option % um-
yes .
% uh chili crab in our chinese restaurant .
% um indian food % uh like curries .
a lot of curries
so , okay .
so , since i 'm going to be ordering % uh singaporean food .
what do you think should i order first ?
since i really have no idea as to what singaporean food has to offer .
so , good-
well , one of our very popular food in % uh singapore would be chili crab , pepper crab .
% uh but it 's not-
you do n't really want to eat with your hands .
chi~
okay .
so , why is that ?
i mean sorry , you will eat with your hands .
rather than eating with your spoo~
% uh fork and % uh knife .
s~
it 's alright .
so , that 's okay .
if i use my hands or if i use my % uh-
if i use silver ware .
that 's okay .
yah .
it 's alright .
it 's perfectly fine when you eat crabs using your hands .
it 's acceptable % uh etiquette % uh out here in singapore .
okay .
now , % um-
so , this is-
we 're quite famous now .
% uh lot of people come here .
and it 's one of the must do in singapore % uh having this % uh crab .
it 's a bit spicy though i must warn you first .
okay .
okay .
wow .
okay .
thank you .
% uh anyway i 'm a fan of spicy foods .
that really wo n't affect me .
okay .
if you want something a little bit % uh not so exotic .
we are also very famous % uh for chicken rice .
chicken rice .
that sounds good .
let me-
let 's see what that is .
yah .
okay .
this is chicken rice .
the chili crab does look tasty , you know .
yes .
the chicken rice is the rice is cooked with the chicken stock .
% uh , so it 's very tasty and-
well , it 's also one of our favourite food out here .
chicken rice .
ye~
wow .
that really does look exotic .
okay .
and % uh-
i 'm thinking she 's going to enjoy those .
% uh , okay .
and of course % uh satay .
okay .
this is satay .
s~
saut~
it 's marinated meat .
you can have chicken % uh mutton .
satay , okay .
lamb .
% uh and of course if you buy them from the chinese store .
then you 'd be able to get pork satay .
but if you buy them from the % uh malay store owner ,
they wo n't sell pork satay .
% uh so this is marinated meat pierced through a skewer , the garnishes .
% uh would be onions and cucumber .
and you can order a side dish of the rice % uh ketupat .
this is rice % uh cooked in % uh leaf .
a packet % uh-
leaf packet , alright .
and this is actually almost a complete meal already .
you have your meat , you have your vegetables and you have rice .
% uh , okay .
wow .
okay .
that does look appetising .
but the chili crab really , you know it does-
it wo n't cle~
it looks yummy , right ?
okay .
so , you can have that -
% oh if you want to have your dinner in another place .
you can choose to go to one fullerton .
yah .
so-
i ca n't get the chili crab off my mind .
okay .
there 's where you can have your chili crabs here as well .
alright .
they serve chili crab at one fullerton % uh .
okay .
okay .
and it 's romantic as well .
you 'll be dining along the marina bay with the merlion in the background .
% um , so that 's very % uh romantic as well in the night time .
wow .
so , which would be further % uh this one or dempsey ?
% um , well i would think that dempsey would be % uh just % uh off orchard road .
% uh , you will have to walk if you really want to walk .
it 's about twenty-five minutes .
and it 's a little bit up slope and down slope .
so , maybe not so conducive if you are talking about % um-
later on you 're going to do a proposal .
so , maybe this would be a better choice .
% um and if you again do n't want to go too far away , you can just walk back on the % uh one fullerton .
% uh just a very slow walk % uh through a three miles of % uh esplanade area .
and you can even do your proposal at the esplanade .
okay .
yah .
okay .
at esplanade , okay .
so , wow i 'm like-
i have so much options now .
yah .
% uh % hm , okay .
so , this is difficult .
% uh , so since i 'm unable to decide .
let 's say-
yah .
so , you can walk back , you know .
remember just now you saw the bay .
okay .
so , you just walk back a little bit % uh on the three % uh line
and you 're still walking on the bay .
so , it 's a nice % uh evening stroll out here .
and again % uh they are not so crowded .
you can always find a spot again to do your proposal if you want to do it .
by the bay or go back to the botanical gardens and do your proposal out there .
actually , i 'm thinking this is more singaporean if i do my proposal out there .
% uh , yah .
yah , because this is very iconic .
% uh the local would like to call this-
it looks like % um the porcupine .
yah .
s~
% oh , okay .
so , that's-
yah . it looks like porcupine , right ?
yah . it looks like porcupine , right ?
there are two of them .
yah .
% uh well , the local like to call this the durian .
which you have this fruit back home as well .
this is-
one of them is a theatre and the other one is % um a concert hall .
so , yes only singapore have these % uh two % uh buildings out here .
so , you can just do your proposal anywhere along the marina bay .
and in the night time , it looks really nice .
see how lighted up it is .
okay .
yah .
okay .
s~
that was what i was thinking .
especially if the moon is out .
right ?
the reflection-
i know there 's a lightning .
yes , it 's actually a nice spot as well .
yah .
okay .
so , the crab -
i 'm still thinking about the crab .
but-
but at least you can always have the crab at the one fullerton .
and you just take a very short % uh walk along the marina bay % uh along the esplanade area .
and you come to the esplanade .
so , a really slow takes you about % uh fifteen minutes .
very slow .
.
okay .
so , i guess i would be doing that from my hotel , % uh in the morning .
then , i 'd be going to botanical garden around lunch time .
i guess .
then during the afternoon , i would take her to the spa .
then , at night i would take her to porcupine .
that sound good ?
okay .
yah .
yah , it sounds good .
but we do n't call it porcupine .
we called it the esplanade .
okay , esplanade .
okay .
yah .
esplanade theatres by the bay .
% um , yes . so , maybe the % uh morning % uh botanical gardens .
% um , yes . so , maybe the % uh morning % uh botanical gardens .
% uh i think you should do it in the morning when it 's not so hot .
% oh , okay .
the-
yah , so-
because the park opens as early as five .
so-
but if you are getting up % uh a bit later is still fine .
but % uh maybe by eleven o'clock , you should leave the botanical gardens .
because it 's starting to get a little bit warm in the afternoon .
% uh , okay .
that 's good advice .
so , i 'm guessing right now it 's a bit % uh humid there .
because here , it 's actually raining .
% uh % hm , okay .
we have the dry day today .
% uh temperature-wise it 's % uh-
well , throughout the whole year it does n't change very much .
% um , approximately in the mid-afternoon about thirty-two degrees -
thirty to thirty-three -
two degrees .
% uh november , december possibly about thirty degrees in the mid-afternoon .
morning , evening right up to about nine a.m . in the morning .
it would be in the temperature range of about twenty-six degrees .
and slowly rising up to thirty degrees .
it 's okay .
okay .
okay .
that sounds good .
so , i guess i have my first whole big plan .
so , what do you think should i be doing on my second day at singapore ?
well , if she accepts your proposal , then of course you can do a bit of sightseeing in singapore .
right ?
so , you could do a little bit of the % uh what do you called that ?
the photo spot to have % uh some good memories of singapore .
so , again if you just go back-
% uh , okay i would say that you would probably have some photograph taken in the night time of the bay .
as well as the merlion .
alright , the merlion that is facing the bay .
.
yah .
yah .
wow .
yah .
that looks good .
okay .
let 's scroll down again .
and see whether we get the merlion .
yes .
okay .
and can see the merlion out here ?
yah .
i do .
okay , so you-
so , you would probably be getting some spot .
so , the next day you do n't have to come back to the marina bay .
so , what you do is % um you can go to our ethnic areas .
so , i 'm guessing going to eth~
% uh like-
go ahead .
okay .
you can go to a place called % uh kampong glam .
okay .
% uh how do you spell that ?
% uh what am i looking at right now ?
okay .
just give me moment .
okay .
so , i 'm guessing this suggestion of yours .
this is going to give us the singaporean culture experience .
yes .
so , that-
so , you know-
well you can go to this place .
there % uh % hm .
that 's popular right ?
that lion statue -
thing .
it 's pla~
the food as well .
okay .
okay .
and this you can try again some % uh malay cuisine , indian cuisine , arabic , egyptian cuisine , turkish cuisine .
they can be found in this area called kampong glam .
alright .
now , % uh this street is called haji lane .
kampong -
okay .
it 's quite a big street .
because the shops are owned by pretty young entrepreneurs .
and the kind of products they carry % uh would be one of its kind .
so , you do n't find them in % uh our shopping mall .
so , they basically have just one shop .
if , you know you are not into shopping .
your girlfriend not really into shopping .
it 's also a very nice % uh way to just soak in a little bit of the atmosphere out here .
% uh and just have the feel of these quaint % uh shops .
and you can see this particular street is quite narrow .
so , this is haji lane over in kampong glam .
alright . you could always stop-
alright . you could always stop-
kampong glam .
k a m p o n g .
next word glam g l a m .
so , you could do a spot of like window shopping .
% uh and % uh this is an area where we allow some graffiti .
% uh to be done to the walls % uh in kampong glam .
yah , % uh % hm .
kampong -
okay .
okay .
thank you .
okay , i-
you do n't have to worry .
since , you know i 'm taking my girlfriend along .
she 's going to be doing some heavy shopping .
so-
okay .
so , she likes some quirky fashion , you know not the run of the mill fashion .
yes , i 'm sure she should be able to pick up something % uh from this lane .
% um , you could also enjoy a sport of % um shisha .
it 's a water pipe .
shisha , % uh % hm .
water pipe .
what-
yes .
wow .
how does it work ?
um-
water pipe , % uh % hm .
okay .
this is-
okay .
this is kampong glam here .
let see whether we get any picture of these water pipes .
it 's % um-
by the way % uh kampong glam is also near in traders hotel ?
well , % um singapore is not that big .
alright .
% uh it 's accessible from the mrt or the buses .
okay .
okay , s~
so , it 's not like-
well , i-
i do n't encourage you to walk from orchard road to kampong glam .
okay .
okay .
i will take that advice .
so , i 'm going to be taking the mrt or a bus towards kampong glam .
yes , that 's right .
okay .
the mrt % uh-
the stop that you 're going to alight would be at the bugis mrt .
okay .
okay .
so , let see-
i 'm going to have to remember that , % uh % hm .
yah , we have % uh -
okay , % uh yah i ca n't find any % uh images of the % uh water pipes .
% oh you could also do-
but-
water pipes .
that would be a pipes with water in them .
is that-
that , okay .
so , i 've got-
yes .
flavoured water .
okay .
yah , okay .
it 's a bit of like smoking .
but % uh instead of % uh the normal way of smoking .
it 's filled with flavoured water .
% uh % hm , okay .
yes .
it 's actually smoking flavoured water .
smoking flavoured water .
that sounds good .
and we 're supposed to be doing some kind of sport there ?
% uh what ?
it 's % uh some kind of sport ?
sport ?
yah .
are we supposed to like go % uh swimming or diving ?
or is it-
over here ?
yah % uh at % uh water pipe .
% uh no .
okay , but now i 'm showing you some photograph of what people-
% um , this is called shisha .
% uh shisha , okay .
yah , so-
no , you are not-
nowhere near waters at all .
in the past , yes kampong glam was right next to the water .
but not today .
okay .
okay .
okay .
so , this is the % uh water pipes and that 's % uh available % uh at the kampong glam area .
okay .
so , i had a different idea of what it is .
okay .
so , a picture % uh says a thousand words , yah .
so , this is the-
what % uh shisha is all about .
okay .
so , it 's something different alright from what you would % uh be able to see or do % um back home .
so , this is one of them .
% uh otherwise , you can always stop for % um a coffee % uh or tea % uh with some snacks .
% um like curry puff .
.
% uh during our second day at singapore ,
i was hoping to get a little bit of historic background on singapore .
but i 'm really not into % uh museums .
so , i was thinking something more of doing sightseeing .
so , % uh % hm .
okay .
okay , alright .
so you can do this % uh sightseeing over in kampong glam area .
you can spend about % uh one hour just to walk around .
% um and also-
okay , but the muslims they do not % uh buy % uh the normal perfumes from the normal % uh kind of the perfume shops .
so , what they do is they buy perfumes .
% uh from this kind of shop they concord their own perfume .
% uh and they do not contain alcohol .
so-
yes .
okay , this is % uh perfume shops in kampong glam .
so , you are asking me about some sightseeing .
so , this is-
you see all the colourful bottles that you can get from kampong glam .
and you can fill them up with perfume .
% uh beautiful fabrics in case she wants to % uh tailor some clothes from these beautiful fabrics .
alright .
so , this is % uh some sightseeing along with a little bit of shopping .
and there 's the houses in kampong glam very historical .
more than one hundred years old .
this is arab street .
traditionally , there was-
this was where a lot of the arabs used to live .
and in fact , a lot of the shop owners here are third generation arabs .
okay , % uh % hm .
wow .
% uh % hm , so-
% oh , okay .
okay .
so , this is a bit of % uh sightseeing cum a little bit of shopping for ethnic products .
example , you can take the mrt again from bugis .
.
okay .
change station at dhoby ghaut mrt train station .
and proceed on to little india .
so , you will get to see the other ethnic area % uh in little india .
little india , okay .
lindia-
india .
okay .
again , very colourful as well .
% uh indian temple out here .
colourful flowers , garlands .
alright .
% uh light up during the deepavali season in the month of november .
so , this is little india .
so , you have a little bit of cultural aspect .
a bit of sightseeing .
% uh the architecture and notice there are two-storey not three-storey .
so , a little bit of that .
i 'm guessing-
i 'm thinking this place is alive during the evening towards night time .
% uh i would suggest that for ethnic area .
it is better to do them in the day time .
because there are more activities going on .
in the daytime .
% um , okay .
that 's good .
and of course if you just walk around the esplanade area .
you will see % uh this building .
that actually looks like a spaceship .
spaceship .
it 's our supreme court .
okay .
yah , so you can do a sport of % uh sightseeing around the bay area .
just about ten minutes ' walk .
so , you get to see the historical area .
for example , this green dome building .
now , it 's undergoing restoration .
this used to be our old supreme court .
and % um-
% uh % hm , okay .
okay .
and this building now that looks like-
i like to call it the spaceship building .
this is our-
it 's supreme court .
okay .
okay .
so , that would be the new one .
the one with the dome on top ?
% uh this one that have this-
yes .
the one with a plate on top .
yah , you called it a plate .
i called it a spaceship .
okay .
okay .
so , this is the new supreme court .
okay .
it 's nice .
you know , if you compare the old-
new architecture the old architecture .
% um and around the-
this greenfield you have of course % uh the colonial buildings of singapore .
so , that 's a little bit of % uh sightseeing out here .
and again you 'll be looking at-
you will also-
okay .
i 'm feeling-
okay .
you are-
you will also be passing by some of these other historical areas .
like % uh the parliament house .
where is that ?
% uh parliament house ?
okay .
it 's all within the vinicity of this rectangular % uh greenfield .
okay .
so , i 'm going to be able to visit all the buildings because it 's close-by .
yes .
it's-
okay .
% uh visit as in passing by or going into the building ?
that looks big .
this one .
okay .
this one is parliament house .
% uh if you want to visit , we-
i would suggest by the side of the parliament house .
we have a gallery .
you can-
if you want to visit .
yes , you can do that .
yah .
% uh if there is no parliament sitting , % uh-
no , then there will be no entry % uh into the parliament house .
yah .
% oh okay .
that sad .
so , there 's a little bit of % uh restriction going into the parliament house .
otherwise , the one that i showed you just now the % uh supreme court .
yes , you are allowed to enter into the supreme court subject to the security checks .
% uh that we will require anyone who needs to enter into the supreme court .
and-
i-
kind of just noticed a picture where there 's a boat ?
% uh if you 'd scroll up a little bit .
are we able to do that there ?
you know , like to ride a-
% uh okay .
that 's good
yap .
okay .
yes , i agree .
but-
yes .
yah .
so , you can do a ride on this boat .
we called it the singapore % uh cruises .
and this boat plies on the singapore river .
% uh % hm , okay .
it is a half an hour ride .
% uh that would cost you fifteen dollars for an adult .
% uh it 's very relaxing .
you know , you can do your walk around the next day -
second day , alright .
do a walk and then-
but if you 're a little bit tired , you can just go on to this boat ride .
% um and there would be % uh english commentary on the boat .
so , you could do this % uh boat ride on the singapore river .
because the river is very historical .
% um and that 's how singapore get rich in the early days .
because this was our port .
so , % uh-
yes , on the boat you will get to have an idea how people used to live along the river .
and these boats in the past used to ferry goods .
but the boats are slightly smaller in the past .
% um and right now % uh these boats are run on electricity .
in the past , they will run on diesel .
okay .
so , that is a relaxing ride on the singapore river .
yah .
okay .
yah , okay .
% uh % hm , okay .
% oh , okay .
okay , % uh % hm .
so , % uh what would you suggest i take the boat ride during the afternoon or during the morning ?
okay .
it does n't make a difference .
i would suggest that in the morning you walk around the % uh padang area .
where you see all the historical buildings .
now , take a two hours walk at-
or three hours walk , you know if some of the buildings you may want to go inside .
and in the af~
% uh have % uh a break for lunch in the surrounding area .
either you % uh break at the raffles place .
there are some small bistro out there .
% uh or you can go to high street again .
it 's just about a five minutes ' walk % uh from the parliament house .
% uh there is a food court there .
that served all the street food . and aboard % uh river cruise , % um-
that served all the street food . and aboard % uh river cruise , % um-
% uh on the singapore river .
alright .
and the boat will again bring you all the way out to the marina bay .
and you get to see the merlion
% uh from a different angle .
alright .
the first night , you are on the edge of the marina -
% uh of the merlion .
now , if you take this boat you are looking at the merlion from the waters .
okay .
% uh % hm , okay .
okay .
okay .
that sounds good .
okay .
so , that you can do in the afternoon , late morning .
it 's fine .
% uh then you could have a spot of % um lunch -
alright , a leisurely lunch .
and take a rest in the % uh hotel before you do another night spot again .
okay .
well , actually the sightseeing i will be doing much more of that .
but the shopping , that 's what my girlfriend would be there for .
she would probably shop 'til she drops .
if you know what i mean .
okay .
so , after your boat cruise % uh what you could do is you bring her back to the-
again , if you do n't want to go too far away from where you are .
you could just do a very small area .
then , you go to the shopping centre called % uh raffles city .
so , that would be close to the hotel still ?
yes .
okay .
alright .
so , raffles city % uh they are like five-
four lev~
% uh five level , two basement area .
% uh where she can do her shopping .
branded stuff mid-range .
and if that is not enough still she can go to the underground .
and do % uh some serious shopping again .
the underground city mall -
% uh citylink will be just mid-range products .
and if again that 's not enough , by the time she goes through the underground city ma~
% uh , okay this is a picture of the raffles city .
by the time she walked over to another shopping mall called marina square .
so , yes she can really shop 'til she drop .
okay .
okay .
.
could-
okay .
% uh i just hope i bring enough % um money for that .
do n't worry .
our shops here we accept plastic cards .
okay .
okay .
so , she can do % uh spot of % uh serious shopping again in the marina % um % uh square .
alright .
i 'm just hoping that after all the shopping .
she is going to do-
she is going to remember that i proposed to her , you know .
she might forget that i actually proposed the day before .
so~
okay .
so , you must remember to buy her a big diamond ring then .
okay .
alright .
okay .
so , that 's a lots of shopping % uh options % uh available .
and again if you do n't want to get too far away-
but if you want to see a little bit more , then of course you can always go back to the orchard road .
% um % uh for her shopping % uh requirements .
okay .
% uh thank you .
% uh that was a lot of shopping malls .
yes .
% uh anyway , % um for our second day what do you think would be % uh something unique ?
just like the crab , but something else .
i was-
i 'm still thinking about the crab , but that would be our highlight for our first day .
yah , for the food -
singaporean food .
but what about the second day ?
what do you think should i 've order first ?
something-
yah , something sweet , but romantic .
yah and local of course .
okay .
% oh for food is it ?
sweet and romantic and yet local .
so , are you going to have it in them-
in the restaurant or in the % uh hawker centre at the non-air-conditioned food place ?
at-
i guess since we 're going to be walking around a lot .
i guess we could have it in a restaurant .
okay .
% uh sweet , okay .
i mean like main courses generally they will not be sweet .
% um but something that is very unique and i do n't think you get that in % um % uh philippines .
% uh remember the satay that i showed you ?
yah .
i do .
okay .
so , % uh you could do that .
% uh do you still need me to show you the photographs of satay ?
no , that 's okay .
i still remember .
okay .
so , you can have that .
yes , it 's a little bit % uh sweet .
% uh otherwise , one of our % uh very popular dish % uh would be this % uh fried noodles -
hokkien fried noodle .
frie~
prawn mee recipe .
okay .
so , those are fried noodles .
yah .
okay .
so , this is the % uh something which is quite unique % uh in singapore .
it 's cooked with a little bit of seafood .
alright .
yes .
and some of the store do serve them with a piece of banana % uh leaf at the bottom .
and then you can see there 's a lime for you to make the dish a little bit sour .
of course , the chili will be a little hot .
% um yah , something a little bit unique out here % uh in singapore .
okay .
that i would have to remember .
fried hokkien mee .
okay .
hokkien mee .
yah .
alright .
otherwise , if you still would like to do a little bit of sightseeing .
then , maybe i could recommend that you go to the night safari .
night safari .
okay .
that sounds good .
yah .
okay .
% uh fried-
for fried hokkien mee that would be available on almost all the restaurants we go to there ?
yes .
% uh all the restaurant .
chinese restaurant would be able to serve you these dishes .
it 's quite a common % uh food % uh that a lot of the locals like to eat .
% um then you can all-
% um you could have like % uh early dinner .
and then proceed on to the northern part of singapore .
% uh by taking the train and the bus and you will arrive in the night safari park .
because the park only opens in the night time .
okay .
okay .
okay .
% uh this would be at around what time ?
the park opens at seven-thirty in the evening .
okay .
and it closes its door at twelve midnight .
okay .
so , we only have a few hours .
well , it is enough .
if you have two and a half hours to spend inside the park .
% uh it is more than enough time for you to enjoy the park .
% um i 'm looking at the pictures right now .
it does seem like the park is quite big .
% uh yes .
it 's quite a big park .
% um and what you will do is you would go on the tram ride .
if you see this % uh picture over here on the left-hand side .
now , this is a tram ride .
so , you get onto this tram .
the whole ride without stopping will take you about forty minutes .
but if you make a stop midway and you walked % uh the leopard 's trail .
% uh that will take you about half an hour to forty minutes to do the walking trail .
and when you finished the trail , you come back to the tram station .
and you board the next tram back to the entrance .
and if you still are energetic enough , you can still do another walking trail .
alright .
% uh because on the tram itself you actually get to see seventy per cent of the animals .
yah % uh .
okay .
okay .
% uh yah , i 'm hoping i 'm energetic enough to do those walks .
yah .
it is not then-
it 's good enough if you just do the tram ride .
% uh you already see seventy per cent of the animal .
and i think that would be sort of a wrap up in your second % uh day in singapore .
wow .
this looks good .
so , that would take me forty minutes to finish ?
% uh yes .
just on the tram ride itself without stopping .
without getting off the tram , you would take forty minutes .
okay .
so , i guess that would mean that my first and second day is fully booked .
yes .
you would actually need more time here .
but % uh if you have just two days , % um-
yes this is % uh maybe something that i would be able to recommend you .
based on your requirements .
okay .
since i 've got my first and second day booked ,
i 'm hoping that all the suggestions that you have given me are your personal choices , you know .
since % uh you 're female and all .
i 'm hoping that all these places are % uh-
i guess i should call it close to your heart ?
% um yes , i think % uh based-
like i said on what your % uh-
well , your coming here of course the highlight ,
most important one would be your proposal .
a little bit of sightseeing .
a little bit of relaxation .
and not just hopping from place to another .
and i think this would be-
well , % uh what i would recommend for you to do in singapore .
okay .
and i 'm just really hoping she remembers that i am going to propose to her .
well , after a nice holiday ,
i 'm sure she will remember .
yah .
okay , so % uh what do you suggest that we do next ?
we 've got a little bit of-
i guess an hour and a half to relax .
% uh we 're going to be doing the spa on the first day .
and after all these % uh walks on the second day .
what do you think would be the best place or where do you think would be the best place to relax ?
well , okay after the % uh-
if you two decide to exit from the park ,
at the main entrance area , we have what we called the foot reflexology .
% uh % hm , okay .
okay .
and % uh you will soak your feet in this pool .
% uh and these fishes will come and nibble at your feet .
% uh and they will nibble away all your dead skin .
have you had this experience before ?
% oh okay .
% uh no .
but i think my sister did .
she did % uh visit singapore before .
it 's actually the reason i chose to go to singapore .
it 's because of her suggestion that i visit there .
so , she did mention fish nibbling off her feet .
so-
yah that 's good .
yes .
so , you could do that .
% uh and they have % uh a spot of this % uh fish at foot areas-
fish spa .
% uh just outside the % um-
the night safari park .
okay .
so , i guess that would complete our % uh visit to singapore .
yes .
that you can see the picture now .
the-
these are doctor fish .
so , they come and nibble at your fish .
and the sensation will be a little of this % uh tingling-
ticklish .
yah , ticklish effect .
and then-
yah , yes you will feel pretty relaxed after this % um % uh spot of % uh at % uh fifteen minutes .
ticklish .
okay .
wow .
it 's good enough .
yah % uh relax .
yah .
so , we end up the day with that .
i 'm ac~
i'm-
i 'm % uh actually thinking that this person on the picture has a lot of dead skin .
so-
s~
maybe .
yah that 's why the fishes are going i think to her feet .
right ?
crazy .
they 're going crazy .
okay .
okay .
so , you get this % uh well spa .
and you get the nice-
at the same time your feet feel relaxed , you know after a day of walking .
and your dead skins are removed .
yes .
so , i think it 's a nice day to end the day .
okay .
% uh great .
% uh i guess i 've got my first day and second day complete now .
so , % uh great .
thank you .
i really enjoyed our conversation .
thanks very much for calling us .
% um hey , % uh would you mind if i ask for your name again ?
this is lynnette here .
lynnette , okay .
thank you so much lynnette .
i really enjoyed our conversation today .
okay . so , thanks again don romeo .
okay . so , thanks again don romeo .
right ?
okay .
% uh that would be don rommell .
and rommell is okay .
okay .
alright % um .
okay .
okay .
bye .
thank you .
bye .
okay .
bye .
hello .
hello .
hi .
good afternoon .
hi , i'm-
good afternoon .
i 'm jeanne and i am guide number two .
who is calling please ?
hi jeanne , my name is june .
% um and i 'm parti~
june ?
yap .
and i 'm participant number thirty-three .
three three , yes ?
yes , that 's correct .
okay .
how can i help you , june ?
hi jeanne .
% um , i will be s~
% uh i just got married
last % uh month
and % uh my husband and i is planning for an asian tour
for our honeymoon .
% um , now , % uh it just so happen that we 're just-
we 're kind of thinking of staying to singapore
% um for at least two nights .
would you be able to help me with that ?
yes .
% uh , what sort of % uh hotel are you looking at ?
% um you mean % um hotel categories ?
yes , that 's right . % uh-
what-
well we 're a kind-
we 're actually working on a budget . % um .
% uh i 'm not really sure and familiar with your hotel categories that you have there in singapore .
it will be our first time .
but if you could work on the budget that we have , that would be great .
and that is ?
what is your budget ?
yep .
% um we 're working on one thousand singaporean dollars .
one thousand dollars for the both of you ?
for the both of us .
that should include our meals , our trips and everything .
okay .
% um so maybe i gave you a hotel that 's not so expensive .
would you like to go to hotel in chinatown ?
% uh it 's a boutique hotel in a conservation shophouse .
so it 's not like a big fat grand hotel that we get in town , you know .
% uh this is more personal .
i see jeanne .
now , my concern is how far would that be from the airport ?
% uh not very far .
shall i show you the airport map first then ?
sure .
okay .
so % um shall there 'll be % um a person or a ride that could pick us up
% uh from the hotel -
% uh from the airport going to the hotel ?
or % um where will-
we take a subway ?
it 's easier .
% uh actually it 's a-
you save money and you save time in the sense that
you do n't have to wait for people to pick you out .
it 's more exciting also because you see the locals .
% ah , okay , you-
what are you seeing is a portion of the mass rapid transit .
okay .
can you see the map with the four colours ?
yes .
so where you get this little round dots that joint up
are the intersections of the different lines .
i'm-
when you come in you are at number three
on the right-hand side of your screen .
okay .
and that is the east-west line
okay .
% uh chinatown is on the purple line .
can you see it ?
purple line ?
% ah okay .
yes % uh-
where you see number six and go you up to outram park and then you go down to chinatown one more stop
and that is chinatown .
so if you take % uh the subway
to town .
and it 's not all the way subterranean .
it is above ground , so you get a bit of sightseeing right up until kallang which-
can you see it on the map ?
on the green line ?
yes , i 'm seeing it right now .
there 's a-
so after you pass there % uh you would go from kallang down towards the purple line .
you see outram park ?
and then you go out up one stop to chinatown .
so there will be % um at least two drop-offs for me from the airport ?
you mean to say that % um i need to take the east-west line until the kallang
and then drop-off there and ride another railway ?
no .
% uh i 'm just saying that up to kallang you can see-
it 's up above ground .
a few metres .
you can see the area .
and then the ground it goes underground % uh and so chinatown area is busy .
so all that is underground and also up to chinatown .
so when you switch , you just get off your train .
there will be announcements to tell you are coming to an interchange .
you % um follow the directional signs
whether you 're going up the stairs or down the stairs ,
you just switch and most likely you go further deeper into the ground .
so you have to take the escalator down .
and then you take it to chinatown .
% ah okay .
okay .
okay .
so % um now that i 'm seeing the map ,
% um where is the city centre ?
okay .
% uh , chinatown is where
we have a large congregation of chinese but we also have one of the oldest hindu temples in chinatown and % uh also have mosque and churches there .
there 's a methodist church in that area .
further along the line is little india which is two stops-
three stops up north .
and % uh there you can % uh soak in the indian atmosphere .
% ah okay .
and , okay , to show you the relation to the rest of the town .
okay , wait .
if you take the purple line down south
can you see number six
on the map ?
bottom left-hand side ?
yes .
yap .
that 's harbourfront and that faces sentosa island
% uh where we had-
oh okay .
what 's sentosa island ?
is that like a real island ?
beaches .
yes , it 's a real island .
a beach ?
it 's an island with beaches but there-
there 's also a road link that you can go over
so % uh after i settle your hotel , you just tell me what you are interested in .
yap .
i just want to know % um where in this map would you find the merlion ?
okay , the merlion is-
okay on the same map ,
can you see % uh-
can you see clarke quay ?
yes .
that 's the stop from which you can walk towards the merlion .
oh that 's nice .
okay .
so i think % um being in chinatown would be a perfect choice then .
okay .
chinatown , alright .
and if you-
since we 're on the map ,
okay .
later you tell me what are the other attractions that you like to visit
what is the-
well , % um merlion is the only one that % uh we know about singapore .
% um my husband would love to % um play golf .
do you golf courses available nearby ?
% uh , we have golf courses on sentosa island .
but % uh let me first % uh show you the merlion that you are talking about .
so the mrt map , the map for the trains ,
do n't show you the location of our rivers .
% uh but here where you see the blue on the map
that is formerly just the entrance to the river .
it is now closed in and it 's a reservoir .
the merlion is-
do you see a little i there ?
can you see ?
yes .
% uh , so that 's the location of merlion park and that 's where the merlion is .
is the half fish and half lion % uh-
first emblem of the singapore tourism board , right ?
okay .
is that % um-
is going to that park for free ?
and-
yo-
yes it 's for free all the time .
day and night .
nice .
okay .
that sounds good .
% um , now , 'cause i've-
as i 've mentioned we 're only gon na be there for two nights .
so that 's basically-
we 're arriving % um around six p.m .
and then % uh we 're gon na be staying the day after then we 're gon na have an overnight and we 're leaving at the following day .
so we 'll basically have a very short stay in singapore .
so % um if you could suggest some activities that we could do .
so as i have mentioned that my husband would love to be-
to have a little tee-off time during the morning
and then % um in the middle of-
perhaps in the middle of the day
if we could have % um , you know , % uh sightseeing .
and then of course at night % uh perhaps i 'd go shopping and % uh try out some % um very good restaurants around .
% uh huh .
okay .
let me try and get you % uh places where you can golf in singapore first .
okay ?
yap .
% uh so how much would the hotel be again ?
oh hotel is a little over a hundred dollars i think .
just a minute % uh .
% hm okay .
okay , maybe this one is very accessible .
this is also on the bay .
okay .
on the bay .
so will that be near the merlion ?
yes , near the merlion .
but % uh you may have to take a taxi there
because % uh it is along the highway .
how much would the taxi fare be from our hotel ?
from your hotel ,
it depends if you 're going during peak hours in the morning
there 's a surcharge .
but it should not be more than ten dollars .
oh okay .
so it 's a very nice area
because it 's right next to the bay and so you can see the sea % uh right there .
% um , could you show me how much that would be ?
okay , i 'm trying to find it here .
okay .
so how is your day going so far jeanne ?
it 's fine .
it 's a fine day in singapore .
no rain .
oh .
yah .
it 's a bit shady here .
% uh got cloudy skies and % um rain is pouring a little bit .
but pretty good .
yes , we have also % uh a bit of hazy skies % uh overcast .
% hm okay .
i 'm trying to find the price of this for you .
okay , that 's fine .
% uh just a minute .
how long have you been % um a tourist guide % uh jeanne ?
a little more than twenty years .
wow that 's nice .
% uh let me see , huh .
a lot of changes in singapore , a lot of new things .
oh that 's nice to hear .
so you can come back every year and you will get new attractions to see .
okay .
just a moment .
sure , that 's fine .
okay , these are the rates .
% uh is it a weekend or weekday ?
did i ask you-
you said june , right ?
you have n't quite fixed the days .
% um well actually we 're spending % um an asian tour .
so perhaps we 're eyeing around % um the ninth of april .
so-
oh !
% uh sorry .
june is your name .
i 'm sorry .
ninth of april up 'til ?
yes .
so we 'll be arriving at the ninth , tenth , o~
oh until the eleventh .
so we 're checking out on the eleventh .
yes .
eleventh .
eleventh , yes .
% uh can you tell me off-hand
is the ninth a weekend or a weekday ?
i believe that 's a monday .
so the ninth , yes , it 's a monday .
and you 're checking out .
so good .
so it 's a non-weekend % uh timing so you are more likely to get
% uh to book your % uh golf session
because it's-
would be a day where people work .
% hm okay .
so how much would that be ?
so i 'm seeing there weekdays for an eighteen hole
is seventy five dollars .
% uh that 's for singaporeans and permanent residents .
you would be in the category of hundred and fifteen dollars .
okay .
oh alright .
'cause you 're a visitor .
okay .
okay , so you do have foreign rates as well .
yes , we do for the golf courses .
% uh and i think there 's some membership if they joined % uh
for singaporeans where they get some discount .
% ah i see .
okay , % uh would you know we~
what time of the day we can start ?
okay .
we had the timings earlier , right ?
i 'm not really sure .
% uh le~
but definitely % um we 're hoping to take the golf % um-
a little-
a golf -
the golf play around % um six a.m . perhaps ?
six a.m . ?
would that be-
yap .
% uh i think it 's still-
would that be possible ?
i think it 's still dark .
you want the eighteen hole ?
yes .
it~
okay , eighteen hole , you want to book the timing , is that right ?
yes .
what times can we % um start with the game ?
six o'clock it is still dark in singapore .
% uh so i do n't think you can % uh book a course
at that time .
see , it 's seven o'clock .
% ah okay , seven o'clock .
but seven o'clock would be okay .
it 's not too bad at all .
% uh huh .
yes , it 's good because at that time it is very cool still .
yes .
the sun will come out % uh about nine
and by ten it gets a bit warm .
oh there .
so the following are the revised tee times for wednesday .
but we 're actually gon na have that on a tuesday .
would you have a tuesday time ?
i thought these are normal times .
% uh what you see here .
okay .
so those are just normal times ?
this-
yes % uh-
oh so do you need to see for wednesday .
so for some reason on wednesdays ,
they have a different timing .
% hm okay .
okay .
so you 're gon na play golf on tuesday , right ?
yes .
okay , what else would you like to know ?
% um so % uh how much would % uh our-
can i have a look at % um your hotel offers ?
okay , you want to see the hotel ?
yes .
okay .
let me get your hotel for you .
so you okay with chinatown ?
yes .
i think that would be a good choice .
% um o~
is it safe there ?
it 's very safe , it 's very convenient .
your singapore is a singapore tourism board website that you can go to
to help plan your tours .
% hm okay .
so-
we're-
just give us a-
just a give us a while for it to come on screen .
okay .
% uh what were you going to ask me ?
% um i hope that the hotel is not that % um-
not on the range of % uh % um like a motel .
% uh what do you mean % uh like a motel ?
like % um-
where in you have a very small room .
% uh the rooms are small in chinatown and in little india
because they occupy what used to be shophouses .
and % uh hotels what they do is they % uh-
the owners buy up several % uh units of these of shophouses
and convert them into hotels .
i see .
but let me show you a picture % uh of the hotel .
can you see here ?
yes , i 'm trying to look at your hotel .
this % uh up .
do you want the picture of the whole hotel ?
% um i just needed picture of perhaps
% um does that hotel have a dining area ?
you-
you want a dining area for the hotel ?
let me have a look .
'cause we might have % um our dinner when we arrive .
okay .
well , you do n't need to worry about the dining area .
this is the reception area .
because in chinatown , after you put down your bags you just walk out
and there are lots of places to eat .
yah , but that would be % um-
we 're already tired by that time .
so we 'd rather stay at the hotel for dinner .
anyways , we 'll have the whole day the ne-
the day after to roam around .
okay , let me see .
it has got-
can you see the amenities ?
internet access , air conditioning , internet services , lounges and bars .
i 'm gon na go to full list .
so lounges , so there is really no % um restaurant in that hotel ?
not in the hotel
but in the vicinity plenty of places to eat .
% uh why the restaurants don't-
% uh why the hotels they do n't provide food
is because i think the guest prefer to just go out and try
% uh either street food or food from the cafés and restaurants nearby .
% ah , okay .
yah .
you might be able to get the % um concierge
to buy something for you from somewhere nearby
and just pay him for it .
oh okay then .
alright .
so it 's indicated there that there is internet services .
% uh will that be for free ?
yes , internet services are-
all these services here are usually free .
if they want you to pay , they will tell you that you have to pay .
oh okay .
% uh can i check on the % um pictures of the room ?
okay , the pictures of the room .
this is the outside .
why do n't i go through the pictures , shall i do that ?
okay .
'cause i ca n't quite make out from here % uh what is being shown .
okay .
this is interior .
this is just outside .
this is the entrance .
okay .
oh so it is decorated in traditional style
% uh with % uh with traditional porcelain ware
and there on the side you have tourist brochures that you can pick-up .
and those are for free ?
free , yes .
for free and they are very informative .
you can-
% uh if you get them , the walk of chinatown you 'll be able to
% uh follow it and do a walk .
this is a traditional set of % uh tables that we used to have in our kitchen .
so you can have breakfast in your kitchen , marble table and two chairs .
so % uh this is the dining area .
actually i think you can get-
can you see this at the corner on the left-hand side ?
you should be able to get snacks like curry puffs , cakes .
okay .
% uh coffee and tea .
as you go upstairs , this is your room then .
% ah so you do n't have elevators on that hotel ?
% uh i do n't think so because these are just three-story buildings .
they 're very small .
% uh they are very cosy
because they are in restored buildings that are protected .
okay .
are you thinking of % uh more modern type of hotel ?
% hm maybe around two to three stars hotel or to three to four-star hotel ,
would that-
how much would that cost in singapore ?
so-
so you want a two to three-star hotel-
or three to four .
three to four-star hotel
yah .
not much of a budget
'cause as you know % um this will be a honeymoon for us .
so of course % um staying at the hotel would also be part of our adventure .
okay .
shall we try this furama % uh riverfront hotel .
okay .
it 's by the river and % uh it 's a more modern style hotel with larger rooms .
okay
wow it is nice .
yes , % uh-
it 's your preference , you know what i mean ?
this is-
wow !
okay .
yah .
this is larger-
that 's nice .
so the reception areas are larger-
let me go through the-
% uh it 's going through automatically .
that 's the reception area .
that looks better .
okay i know you now that you like modern hotels , huh .
they have a good buffet spread .
okay .
if you have a good appetite .
so we do ha~-
% uh that one hundred seven three singaporean dollars is inclusive of breakfast ?
% uh i have to check that out .
okay .
let me see if it 's inclusive of breakfast .
yah .
so do you ac~
it doesn't-
yah .
sorry .
it does n't say here .
it does n't state it .
okay .
so how do i booked that ?
i just go to that website ?
yes , you go that website .
% uh it 's by the river and it 's not so near to chinatown then .
you have to travel by bus into chinatown .
but this is definitely a bigger hotel , i think more to your taste .
% ah okay , it 's far from chinatown .
so it would be wi~
no , it 's not far .
it 's about two , three bus stops away .
the chinatown area has another hotel in chinatown
but it 's not as pretty as this one from the outside .
it 's an older version of a hotel .
well i 've seen that % um next to chinatown will be clarke quay .
is that somewhere in north clarke quay ?
% uh yes , it is .
you have to walk to clarke quay from here .
but it 's within walking distance .
% ah okay .
walking distance from clarke quay , okay .
yes , walking distance to clarke quay .
there is another hotel by the river if you want to be on the riverfront ,
is called the gallery hotel .
but let 's have a look at this one .
there 's another furama -
you want to be in the middle of chinatown ?
i wan na be in the middle of the city
so that i can % um be readily accessible to the attractions .
this is also in the city .
is just % uh not as convenient as the previous hotel that i showed you .
because , the chinatown stop on the subways
stops exactly there .
% uh here it is better if you are tired of walking , you can take a bus
to connect with the trains to reach your hotel .
okay .
so which stop from the railways -
which railway station shall i shop in order for me to get a bus ?
you just stop at the city centre and then you get out and you take one bus number one nine five
and it will bring you to your hotel
in about fifteen minutes or so .
ten minutes actually .
so if we have red lights along the way then its fifteen minutes .
% um what 's the name of the % um station at the city centre ?
the station is city hall .
it 's a major station and it 's in a business district
so you do n't even need to take that train if you outside your hotel if you take the buses ,
% uh you can go to where city hall is
and you can walk around the area .
we have historic buildings there , we have a big theatre and concert hall
% uh by the bay .
okay .
yah 'cause i 'm thinking that if i 'm gon na get this hotel -
hello !
oh what you se~
yes , i 'm here .
yap .
so i 'm just thinking that if i 'm gon na get that hotel ,
% um coming from the airport
of course % um i 'm gon na take the subway or the east-west line .
% uh which station should i drop off ?
oh you drop off at city hall station and you take bus number one nine five .
% hm okay .
alright then .
that-
that 's not difficult because it will stop you right in front of your hotel .
% uh does this hotel have a golf course , maybe ?
no we do n't have the size .
% uh our golf courses are separates % uh usually .
oh it 's separate .
% ah yes .
okay .
yah .
that 's nice .
okay .
okay , i think that just % uh
that % uh hotel is more likely that we 're gon na take .
% um , now , once we get-
% uh as you 've mentioned , do you have anything else that we-
after we take the golf course ?
so i have now listed in my plan to go to marina bay golf course .
% uh what other % uh attractions could you suggest for sightseeing
that is nearby from marina bay ?
so % hm .
oh % uh would-
yah .
so from marina bay if you % uh come out and go to the % uh city centre area
that 's where we have the esplanade theatres on the bay .
it 's % uh a big theatre and concert hall .
yah , but that would be % um too lengthy of a time
to stay at the theatre .
just of course we 're gon na watch some things , some shows
and % um i think we do n't have much time to watch some shows .
oh i 'm not suggesting you watch shows .
i 'm just suggesting you have a look at the place % uh
and take photos % uh
because you are looking out at the marina bay sands hotel
which is quite iconic and the % uh bay right in front of the singapore river .
so that 's where many people like to take photographs .
and if you want to have a meal , you can have it % uh inside
% uh the shopping where the % uh theatres are .
can you see the pictures here now ?
% ah okay .
oh yah , it looks like a durian .
durian , yes .
that 's what it 's been called locally .
but , the architect meant it to look like the top of the microphones .
you know the old type of microphone ?
% ah oh yah .
okay .
so you know it as the durian also , huh .
no , i just thought that it looks like a durian
yes , it does look like a durian .
% uh so it 's a nice place to take photographs , to walk around ,
% uh because-
okay , so the-
i can actually go inside , right ?
yes , you can go inside .
and % uh we sometimes do have lunchtime concerts .
% uh but that would depend on % um the esplanade 's % uh schedule .
it 's about only forty five minutes or one hour during lunchtime .
it 's to encourage locals to step into our concert hall .
so that you know later on they would buy the concert tickets
and attend that concerts .
so-
i see .
% um jeanne , % um how long do you think % uh would be enough for us to stay inside ?
% uh well it depends on what you are interested in .
% uh lots of great shops here and % uh chocolate shop
and places where you can have a drink or a meal .
but if you do n't do all that ,
you just take a look and then you walk along the outside .
you can see by the ri~
% uh by the theatre , you can reach the marina bay .
so maybe ten , fifteen minutes inside and outside to photograph it
and then you walk to merlion .
i think fifteen minutes with you stopping to take photographs .
% um % hm fifteen minutes .
so around-
perhaps we 're alloca~
so we 're gon na be finishing our tea golf around nine .
so we 're perhaps if it 's very near marina bay
% uh going to the esplanade would take us around fifteen minutes ?
and then % uh we 're gon na spend at the esplanade around-
so that 's nine fifteen .
we 're gon na be there until eleven perhaps .
yes , you take your photographs , you walk slowly and have a look
soak in the atmosphere .
alright .
or ten thirty and then % uh we can walk going to merlion from here ?
yah .
yes , you can walk and % uh i do that as well .
because , % uh you know , i do n't even think you can take a bus there it 's so near .
right .
okay , so picture taki~
what else can we do at the merlion park ?
from the merlion park ,
i suggest you get across to % uh boat quay and clarke quay .
what can we do there ?
% uh see here , you are at the bay in front of the river .
% uh later you % uh walk along the singapore river itself .
and if you are energetic ,
you can walk all the way home to your hotel .
well , i can deal with that .
i do n't think my husband will be very happy about that .
well , he can play golf , you know .
he is a fit .
so % uh if you did it at seven in the morning , it 's very nice .
i have done it once before .
% uh you come across some joggers , some people walking their dogs .
okay .
% um okay , so we 're gon na stop at merlion -
% um at the merlion park ,
do we have % um restaurants available there ?
yes , there are restaurants % uh nearby at-
because there 's a big hotel called the fullerton hotel
and they own the place in front of the hotel by the river-
oh sorry , by the bay .
it 's called one fullerton and there are lots of
% uh places you could have a meal .
how much would the range of the meals be in that place ?
that place-
% uh depends on what you order actually .
% uh if you go inside the hotel and you eat at the jade restaurant ,
it would cost you a bit more .
maybe % uh sixty or seventy dollars a person .
okay .
if you walk along the singapore river ,
% um there are places that serve lunch
at prices that office workers can afford .
because many office workers in the area behind , can you see the river on the map ?
so on the south banks of the river where you see north canal road ?
behind that area is the business district .
and some of them would actually eat % uh along the singapore river .
so you can get a meal there fifteen dollars , twenty dollars per person .
more than enough for the both of you .
% um i do n't think that walking along would be a really
% um commendable for my husband .
do you have % um car rentals available ?
% uh no , i suggest you take a boat .
would you like to take a boat home ?
you know ?
from the merlion , you can board a boat .
% uh these are electric boats that ply the bay and the river
and they also do like a taxi service alo~
with the stops along the river .
and there is one stop
at the back of your hotel .
% hm that 's nice .
how much is the boat ride ?
oh % um if you 're taking the taxi ride ,
it 's under ten dollars .
% uh if you do a tour with them going around the bay
then it 's about fifteen dollars or so .
% hm okay .
alright .
so were gon na have lunch perhaps nearby the merlion .
% um do you suggest any ho~
% um promising % um restaurants nearby aside from the jade restaurant ?
% uh just by the river , there are restaurant .
i forget the name % um but it was a very good japanese restaurant
if you like japanese food .
% uh we want authentic singaporean food .
okay .
singaporean food .
% hm let me see .
at one fullerton .
let me check out one fullerton % uh where-
see if they have anything that what-
is what i would consider singapore food , huh .
the one fullerton areas for food .
the hotel is the fullerton hotel .
but one fullerton is the name of the area opposite
where we have all the restaurants .
so that is just across the hotel ?
yes , of the-
okay .
oops !
i got the wrong spelling there .
okay .
singaporean food , you
do you like seafood ?
seafood , yah .
okay , there 's one right next to the merlion .
and this is a website % uh put up by a singaporean who checks out places to eat .
palm beach .
so-
so you can get crabs there ,
you can get a % uh-
you-
have you heard of chicken -
% uh sorry , % uh chili crab ?
% um perhaps .
would you kne~
would you tell me something more about it ?
can you take hot food ?
yes .
both of us love hot food .
so , chili hot , huh ?
yah .
okay .
so chili crab is % uh the big crab that is cooked
in chili sauce and tomato sauce with onions and egg and a little bit of flour .
so here you see some pictures of it .
wow .
if you 're thinki~
that looks
delightful .
yes it 's very nice .
it 's finger licking good ,
so , you must use your hands to eat .
% ah okay .
it 's quite acceptable , yes .
that 's nice .
% uh you can tell the waitress that you do n't want to take too hot chili
and then they will tone it down .
but if you want more chili , you can tell them also .
okay .
so , right .
so we have half of the day planned .
% um right after lunch , that would be around two p.m .
what would be a good thing to do ?
you can % uh-
what other places-
what are your interest besides % uh the golf ?
well , for me , i plan to shop .
but , % um i do n't think at two p.m . that would be a really nice
% um time to shop
'cause it might be too hot .
oh if you do street shopping ,
then it 's a bit warm .
but if you 're going to the shopping malls , % uh-
let me try and get you-
do you want to go shopping along the more
expensive areas or are you thinking of street shopping ?
% um , well , street shopping would do i think .
'cause % um i 've heard that 's really expensive when we go to
shopping malls in singapore .
% uh shopping malls not really expensive
% uh in the sense that the shopping malls have a mix of
expensive as well as not so expensive % uh items .
street shopping i think in chinatown you can do it in the evening .
yah .
% uh it-
but around two p.m . what do you think we do-
what do you suggest for us to do ?
let me tra~
okay , if you want to get away from the heat and near to your hotel ,
you can visit a museum
just across the road .
oh nice .
okay .
okay .
across the road of our hotel ?
yes , the asian civilisations museum .
do you have a singapore museum
where we can actually % um % uh learn about singapore ?
yes .
let me % uh get you this museum first .
if you talking about history
is the singapore history museum .
% uh this one will give you % uh only singapore ,
the history around the river .
that means the early history of singapore and what went on by the % uh-
sorry .
asian-
i 'm not sure .
% um i have seen this % um documentary from % um national geographic .
% um there is a museum where you have bottles of water on the wall
because % um they 've said that % um water was very % um-
a very important resource way back then as it you actually import that .
is that true ?
civilisation .
yes , we import water .
so that museum is % uh-
it 's by the bay .
it 's called marina barrage .
are you interested in that ?
yes , i think i 'd like to see that wall with a lot of mineral % uh water bottles .
% uh it 's just the empty water bottles , huh .
used for the decor it 's called the marina barrage .
and-
% uh it will tell you about the bay that you 're looking at
right in front of you at the merlion .
so , can you see the pictures there ?
% um but tiny .
yes , tiny .
so here you go .
so there is % uh or i do n't know whether you can call it a museum
but when you enter ,
it gives you the history of singapore in fact and the development along the rivers .
% uh all the rivers .
our efforts like cleaning up all our rivers
because now some of the rivers flow into this area
that is called the marina bay .
and that 's how we are able to close it off .
can you see it at this picture here ?
can you enlarge that for me ?
yah , i 'm trying to enlarge it .
it 's a little bit slow .
is it free to enter that barrage ?
yes , it 's free .
okay .
okay .
so it 's designed a little bit like % uh the number nine .
% hm what 's the significance of number nine ?
well for-
well it 's just the architect 's design .
but % uh for a chi~
yah , for chinese , we do like number nine also .
we have to wait a little bit
% uh for the picture to appear
oh well , that 's fine .
that 's fine .
% um , so we 're going to-
i think this would be a good time for us to check this out after lunch .
yes .
so perhaps around four o'clock
we can go straight to shopping .
do you-
what 's the shopping district called ?
we have many shopping districts .
the one that 's most famous is in downtown orchard road .
and there you get many high-end brands .
as well as % uh medium priced .
% uh another place you might want to check out is opposite to sentosa island
and it 's called vivocity .
it 's very popular everyday % uh especially in the evenings after work .
can i get-
vivocity and harbourfront .
% hm harbourfront .
% hm okay .
% um can i get % um tokens
like a souvenir items from those shops ?
% uh , you can get them there .
but you might want to-
if you want to save money ,
you go down to chinatown and you would be able to % uh
buy more things with your money .
% hm okay .
that 's nice .
that 's very cost effective .
okay .
so during the evening , what do you suggest
% um for us to take our dinner ?
i wanted something special this time .
yah .
% uh you might want to have dinner % um-
let me see , huh ?
marina barrage .
do you want to have dinner at % uh the marina bay sands ?
% uh it 's an integrated resort with very high-end % uh restaurants .
how much would that-
would do you think would cost us to have dinner there ?
so % uh-
maybe two , three hundred dollars for the both of you .
two to three hundred dollars for the both of us ?
yes .
okay , so i 'm just trying to think .
a hundred and seventy three ,
so that would cost us around % uh three hundred forty six
and then we 're gon na have three hundred .
so that would mean we 're only left with
less than four hundred dollars to spend .
so-
yah , that said so .
but here you get sort of-
can you see fine dining and casual dining ?
so if you do n't pick fine dining
it would n't be so expensive then .
% um anything else that you think would not be too costy ,
but still going to be very romantic for the both of us ?
let me think , huh .
let me find a-
a hotel maybe at the-
how much-
what is your budget ?
well , as i 've said % um for the entire trip
% um we 're only working on one thousand
singaporean dollars .
so that 's for everything .
so-
so your budget for this good meal , that does n't cost too much ?
does n't cost too much .
but as i 've said % um i 'm good with the hotel .
so that 's one hundred seventy three for per night .
that-
if i 'm going to ha~
stay for two nights that would mean three hundred forty six in total .
so i 'm left with like less than nine-
% um six hundred dollars to spend for the whole day .
so % um a lot of places that you 've mentioned % um will be
% uh huh .
and your-
your golf is a hundred and fifteen
so you have to take that off .
yah .
yap , so i 'm left with four hundred .
so you have % uh-
four hun~
five-
four-
four hundred .
yah , roughly four hundred dollars .
double-
five-
five hundred and thirty five dollars ,
and you do n't want to spend it all on dinner ?
yes , of course .
% ah okay .
'cause of course we 're still going to shop .
i 'm going to shop .
so perhaps shopping would be around two hundred ?
two hundred , three-
two hundred .
so you can eat here .
so two hundred if you take it out for shopping
you still have three hundred over dollars for a fine meal .
so you can even do fine dining here .
yah , but of course we still have to take % um transportation and all this stuff .
tips and anything .
so , you know , we do n't wan na be too tight .
i see .
yes .
okay , we got the menu for you here and should have a price there .
can you read it ?
the price , not really clear for me .
you ca n't see the price .
let me see .
is that the one below each of the meal ?
like this mesclun salad is fourteen dollars ?
fo~
the-
yes , that is right .
% ah okay .
so , you see , if you do n't order of full meal
from salad , soup , main meal and then have a dessert and coffee
it would n't cost you so much .
it's-
if you go the all-
the full works with wine and everything
then it would be more expensive .
okay , but this marina bay sands is really good .
yes , it 's % uh the chefs are well-known
and the ambiance is good .
i do n't know what that hotel or what that place is
but % um i have seen pictures of a floating building
and it's-
% uh it 's not really floating .
it looks floating .
it 's a three towers % uh on the opposite side of the bay .
so from where you are looking at it ,
sometimes it looks like it 's floating .
yes , you are right .
so what 's that place ?
so that is the hotel and integrated resort .
so we have a casino there actually .
what hotel is that ?
that 's the marina bay sands .
but % uh-
oh so we 're on that place .
know it .
yes , that 's right .
% ah okay .
so are-
is that restaurant that one at the top ?
% uh whether it 's at the top of the hote~
it may not be right at the top
because they have a swimming pool .
it may be there , i 'm not very sure .
wow , it would be amusing to have dinner at that place .
for that i can see the entire singapore , i believe .
yes , bistro moderne i 'm not sure .
a few hotels are at the top but i can not confirm with you
whether this one is at the top .
% ah okay .
well , % um i think i 've got pretty good idea of my tour .
% uh you know what , you 've been very helpful jeanne .
i think i 've got everything that i need .
so i 'm very happy .

would you like to a beach on an island ?
yes .
have you heard of sentosa island ?
i heard it but , i do n't know how to-
% uh i do n't know much more about sentosa island .

okay .
okay .

okay .
so that is really number one % um
ideal tourist spot in sentosa ?
yes .
yes , it is easily accessible .
and it has got other interesting places besides the beach .
okay .
okay .
okay .
so % uh not just beaches for sentosa .
no , they are attractions of sentosa .

the whole island % uh has been transformed into an island
% uh for fun , for relaxation
not only for tourist but also for singaporeans also .
okay .

i heard about that .
% uh if you are not into rides and , you know disneyland kind of % uh background % uh
because i notice you 're interested on the be~
about the beach .
you can also visit an aquarium on the island
where you can see fishes .
yes .
okay .
okay .
actually i 'm open for any suggestions ,
not like-
not such as beach .
i 'm open also for amusements , % um different tourist spot in singapore .
okay .
okay .
so-
but first thing on my mind is beach .
okay .
so here you are looking at % uh view of the beach front side of the island
which is off the-
so this is the sentosa island ?
from sentosa island ?
yes .
sentosa island and you can easily get across
by shuttle bus that is provided by the la~
okay .
shuttle buses .
yes .
okay .
% uh let me go to siloso beach ,
because i want to-
siloso beach .
% uh siloso beach .
i do n't know how it got its ' name
but i believe it 's filipino for jealousy .
jealousy .
yes , % oh jealous .
so that 's the meaning of siloso ?
yes , that is right .
so here you can see some scenes people playing
% uh not % uh badminton but volleyball .
badminton .
volleyball .
no it 's vol~
yah , on the beach normally they play volleyball .
because if there is a breeze % uh , yah .
i think your % uh shuttle cock might blow away into the water .
okay .
but there are no-
okay .
yah , but % uh normally they play frisbee , right ?
% uh yes frisbee also .
yes on the beach .
definitely frisbee .
okay .
% oh okay .
% uh and if you enjoy volleyball , if they are playing , you and your friend
can also ask to join them .
they would be happy to invite you .
% uh so-
yah .
okay .
but nor~
but normally frisbee % uh one of the favourite sports .
yes , on the beach .
so if you bring along a frisbee , you and your friend
can enjoy playing that also .
okay .
okay .
so i can see a volleyball .
% hm , you can % uh-
they play volleyball .
yes , % uh that 's when % uh group of friends usually on vacation
during the school holidays .
so that 's on-
so that 's on siloso beach , right ?
yes , siloso beach .
and i 'm going to % uh bring you to underwater world
which is just-
% uh from the beach , you just walk to % uh underwater world .
wow .
okay .
underwaterworld .
is it from sentosa island again ?
yes it 's all on sentosa island .
from siloso beach ?
yes and you notice there 's also a fort there .
can you see siloso point ?
so we will do underwater world first .
they 're all in the same location .
yes .
okay .
okay .
so i see dolphins .
yes , yah .
there 's a dolphin show and you can-
okay .
so some tourist go there ,
to go some dolphins doing a show .
% uh dolphin is an add-on to the show .
% uh the-
okay .
so that is a part of % uh siloso beach ?
% uh no , it 's part of underwater world where you-
it 's % uh , yah .
yah it 's a big aquarium and it 's unusual because
i believe this was the first time and it started what ?
% uh twenty or more years ago
that you also become % uh an exhibit for the fish .
% uh because in the aquarium ,
% uh in the sunken section , you walk-
stand on a travelator around-
% uh that goes around the aquarium and that means there 's gigantic
fish tank all around you .
underwaterworld .
okay .
okay .
fish % oh .
% ah okay .
so it 's like % um ocean park here in the philippines .
yes .
% uh i have n't been to ocean park but % uh
if you have the same technology now , i think they have the same idea
in other parts of the world .
but % uh when it first opened ,
% uh we were told that singapore was the first one .
so where you see the % uh-
% oh okay .
okay .
so this is the undewaterworld ?
yes , the dolphin lagoon is-
lagoon ?
% uh dolphin lagoon is outside the aquarium , it 's part of underwater world .
and you can see the dolphins performing .
okay .
performing , wow .
and if you like you can also pay a small fee
and you-
if you do n't mind getting wet , go down and % uh play with the dolphins .
just a little short while , you know .
because dolphins are very friendly ,
but we do n't want them to be , you know , % uh too long with humans .
they need to be with the dolphins .
okay .
wow .
is it accessible to go surfing ?
% uh surfing , i 'll have to check that out .
% oh not on sentosa island .
sentosa island is n't % um-
you know the beaches are very calm and % uh , yah .
surfing , you need to have very big waves , right ?
to the beach ?
okay .
calm , okay .
yes .
% uh singapore our island is % uh a port
and part of the reason it is attractive to the shipping % uh community
in the very early days
when people use fishing bo~
% uh sailing boats , is that the waters here are very calm .
we are protected by nearby islands .
okay .
okay .
but we can-
okay , but we can also rent a swimming pool .
% uh rent a swimming pool ?
you can stay in a hotel with a pool if you like .
% ah okay .
stay with-
in a hotel with a pool , okay .
so how about % um some amusement parks ?
yes .
okay , sentosa is a huge amusement park .
yes .
like you said % um it has some many amusement park .
what sort of amusement are you looking at ?
animal and wildlife or theme parks .
wildlife , yah .
wildlife , okay .
i 'll get out of this and % uh we 'll go to
one of my favourite places .
actually three of my favourite places .
so i 'll go to their website .
really ?
okay .
so this is the website ?
yes , this is the website .
okay .
and you 'll be able to see some pictures .
there are three parks manage by wildlife reserves ;
the bird park , the singapore zoo .
both of which you visit in the day .
okay .
zoo ?
okay .
it 's an open zoo next to a reservoir .
so it is very % uh unusual .
you do n't see so many animals within cages ,
% uh , yah .
so you know zoos normally % uh when you take photographs
sometimes it 's does n't look real .
but at the singapore zoo , you can , you know
produce a photograph as though you are seeing the animal out in the wild .
cages .
okay .
okay .
so we can mingle with some animals , take pictures ?
yes , you can mingle with them .
% uh and let me get to the bird park first , okay ?
okay .
okay .
no worries .
so this is the wildlife website .
yes , for the wildlife website .
the wildlife reserves .
is-
is do~
hornbill .
yes .
have you seen hornbills ?
% hm some pictures .
here you see the real ones now .
yes .
there are % uh very big aviaries where the hornbills are inside and
they have successfully breed in singapore .
so we have singapore citizen hornbills .
okay .
okay .
hornbills .
and % uh we in fact have been so successful .
we have release them into % uh mainland singapore .
that means they become naturalised already and
maybe when you come down the shopping area , you might even see
a hornbill flying over your head .
yes .
so-
but here you can see the hornbills close-up .
different varieties of them .
okay , so they have many horbi~
so different varieties of hornbills .
yes , so different colours .
so i 'm trying to show you a little bit more of the % uh bird park .
bird park .
okay , attractions .
okay .
so here you can see free-flight aviary .
yes .
so here you walk in and you can see the birds feeding .
i will just going to walk ?
you go inside ,
the birds are flying all around you .
okay .
so you 're actually inside the aviary .
and these feeding trace are very near the path where you walk ,
and the birds are-
they are used to tourist and locals feeding up-
okay .
so we can also feed them ?
% uh feeding ?
% uh the food is put there for you take photographs .
but if you get the schedule of the feeding time when you enter
then you can time yourself to be at the areas when they are feeding .
okay .
okay .
alright .
sounds interesting .
and if you are tired walking , there is a monorail .
in fact the only monorail in the world that drives into an aviary .
so the monorails stops inside this big huge % uh
like a bird cage that you are actually inside .
all the-
okay .
aviary .
so this is applicable when i am tired walking around .
yes , that 's right .
or you can take the ride and then after that you have seen an overview at everything
and then you start walking .
yes .
and now for feeding , you can not bring your own bird seeds .
you have to % uh pay a small sum from the keeper % uh-
% oh so i 'm going to pay to feed the birds .
yes , just a few dollars .
okay .
he will give you a little cup of worms .
worms .
yes .
do you like to handle worms ?
not so much .
okay , when you carry the cup and the birds fly in and take it off the cup .
but if you like to try , you let the worms sort of tickle your arm
and they come down and feed .
so norma~
so normally they are feed worms ?
yes , in this aviary , they are fed live worms .
live worms ?
yes , so you know , % um it 's a healthier food for them .
yes .
and all around you are fruit trees ,
and trees that the birds feed on .
okay .
and you see the waterfall at the back of this picture ?
yes , beautiful .
yes , it 's very nice place for photography .
so two of you going , you can stand there and take photographs .
yes , my friend love to take photographs .
huh .
% uh you can also walk up the hill of that % uh aviary .
it 's a very quiet place .
so there is a hill ?
% uh the park is sighted on the side of a hill .
so % uh there are some areas that many tourist do not go to
because you have to climb just a little bit % uh-
just a little bit ?
yah it 's like % um maybe two floors , you know , you 're climbing two floors
instead of taking the lift .
and you-
those areas are very quiet .
so if you sit there quietly with your friend ,
he would be able to get very natural photographs of the birds with the trees in the background .
two floors .
okay .
okay .
because the birds stop and feed .
so i see different variety of birds .
and we also have % uh shows .
a bird shows ?
yes , bird shows .
some like hornbills ?
% uh the bird show is a different variety of show .
okay .
let me see if i can get it .
but in that place also ?
yes , in that place also .
okay .
i see .
so can you see some pictures here on your right ?
yes .
% uh this is in an open area and you get eagles , hawks and falcons , % uh owls also
swooping down just a few inches from the top of your head .
so when you watch the show , you and your friend must remained seated .
you must remember that .
okay .
it 's very exciting because % uh
they are very close to you ,
and you see this girl on the right ?
yes .
so i see-
yah % um mongolia falcon tree .
yes , that is right .
it 's a % uh a reproduction .
so we do n't have a mongolian person there ,
but he 's dressed like a mongolian .
yes .
so we try to give some information in these shows
to tell you the background of how the % uh hawks were trained .
% uh if you volunteer like this lady here ,
% uh you do n't have to be % uh lady .
sure .
yes .
she volunteered , yah .
yes , you % uh-
this one , you know , % uh she 's % uh probably a park worker
because they used her for the advertisement .
% uh you can also volunteer and have them land on you
because you are adults .
if you are a young child , they will not select you .
okay .
so she use it-
yes .
okay , she volunteered it for commercial purposes ?
no , she is a park % uh staff .
i know her .
yes , i recognise her .
she 's one of the trainers of the birds .
so i think % uh instead of paying a model to model for this
she did it but % uh there are many people who are very happy
to go up on stage and % uh take photographs % uh with the birds .
a staff ?
yah .
sorry .
a staff can do .
yah .
you have to wear a glove .
can you see where her hand is ?
where the birds is ?
and so that 's a gloves .
yes , it 's a very thick leather gloves .
so you do n't worry , your-
the bird will not , you know , % um hurt your fingers .
so i see a mongolian
% uh like a mongolian trainer riding in a horses .
yes and it was a sport % um with the middle eastern people also .
but you do n't hire mongolian people .
well , not if they are singaporeans around there .
not many mongolians in singapore .
yes .
yah i know .
we also have shows for children ,
but i mean this is more exciting show % uh that you may want-
yah , for adults like me .
yes , that 's right for adults .
so-
% oh i see an owl .
yes an owl .
% uh they actually show you how % um you can train a bird .
% uh birds are very difficult to train .
yah .
so difficult to train .
be~
yes , i have seen the training sessions .
some of the birds fly up the trees and they just do n't come down .
so-
so it took % uh about a weeks to train a bird ?
% uh i 'm not sure .
i do n't think a week is enough .
okay .
can i show you the other locations ?
the zoo and the % um the zoo and the night safari .
okay , so do you have a tiger show or lion shows ?
% uh no , you just watch them .
because those animals are very difficult to train .
and we are-
we do n't take risk with our tourist .
but you can see a nude lady here .
i do n't know if she 's a lady .
do you see the picture ?
yes .
difficult .
yes .
this is % uh naked mole rat .
naked mole .
naked because it has got no hair .
mole rat .
yes .
but she has big teeth .
yes that is right .
% uh i 'm not a scientist .
but i 'm sure those teeth have some reason .
probably to dig the tunnel and also to get food .
okay , so some tourist got interested seeing this naked mole .
% uh that is like the latest attraction , you know .
% ah so this is the latest attraction ?
so-
yes because i have n't seen it myself .
for the wildlife .
yes .
so i saw a giant elephants .
so-
yes , this is one of the shows you can see .
% um and you can also participate at the end of the show
by feeding .
so you just pay a few dollars to the keeper , and he will provide you the food .
you must understand that this is to make sure
the animals are fed with healthy food , you know
we do n't want them to get
yah .
feeding .
yes .
yah .
so what if % uh i want to sit on the elephant 's back ?
yes we have elephants rides as well .
so i can pay a little bit .
yes , you can also do that .
not so high .
no , it 's not so high because
the ride in singapore is not a very long journey .
% uh i do n't know whether you 've taken this rides before .
yes .
% hm not yet .
% uh it 's a little bit bumpy .
% uh so the rides are not extensive .
you know what i mean ?
because go to some other countries , they go into the jungle and
halfway if you do n't like it ,
you have to maybe complete the circuit .
extensive , yes .
yes .
so like in thailand elephant is most popular animal .
yes , that is right .
yes .
in fact i just went there and % uh my % uh nieces they went on the elephant rides .
okay .
% uh you can also sit on horses .
% uh we have % uh horses
horses ?
yes , for-
that 's for children % um of up to a certain % uh heights .
and someone will lead them on the path .
can you see this % uh jungle breakfast with wildlife ?
okay .
yes , jungle breakfast with wildlife .
% uh yo~
i saw an chimpanzee % uh .
no that 's an orangutan .
no % uh monk~
orangutan , sorry .
yes .
% uh these are-
% uh now that there are in singapore for a long time ,
% uh we feel confident enough to put them in the open
but % um in a certain areas .
so % uh lots of trees and trees that have fallen ,
we 've use them to create a pathway for the orangutans to climb and to walk .
yes .
okay .
so we can feed them also ?
% uh you do n't really feed them .
what you do is you take a photograph with them .
okay .
so you see you are eating a normal breakfast here .
and the orangutan would % uh have his own breakfast .
because his basket there is full of fruits .
yes .
yah , i sa~
with also with banana .
bananas , % uh durian .
have you heard of durian ?
yes .
% uh smelly food but very delicious like sweet custard .
so when it 's seasoned he gets to eat it .
% um the-
so is this orangutan a female or a male orangutan ?
i ca n't quite tell .
% um sometimes when they come out ,
they bring along their baby .
then you know for sure it 's a female .
so after breakfast , the trainer will invite you
to go up and take a photograph with the orangutan .
yes .
wow .
orangutan .
so you just have to be careful not to touch the young .
okay .
% uh or-
so this % uh singapore zoo can offer us % uh
breakfast , dinner or lunch .
% oh yes , there 's a restaurant right there
which is glass all around .
so while you 're eating , you can watch-
so different restaurants ?
% uh it 's a different restaurant .
that we can choose .
% uh this is a programme only in the morning
where you can take photographs % uh with the orangutan .
when you are having % uh dinner or lunch ,
% uh you do n't have this programme available .
but we have restaurants within the zoo
in air-conditioned areas if you think it 's too hot
or you may want to sit outside .
so there is % uh-
can you see the list of restaurants there ?
okay .
okay .
yes .
pizzafari .
so-
so that 's a pizza joint .
there 's a
a popular kfc restaurant .
yes and ben and jerry 's ice cream .
okay .
yes , ice cream .
and ah ming is the name of our escort orangutan who has passed away .
and she was given-
so ah ming are named after the orangutan ?
yes , a female who was very popular
and she 's been buried at the zoo .
if you like you can visit the burial spot .
yah .
burial spot .
% uh this is the restaurant there .
so that is a year ago ?
i think may be a ye~
two years ago , i 'm not sure .
yes .
two years ago .
so because-
so this restaurant built % um two years ago .
no , this restaurant no was built much longer
but it has been furbished .
but it has been given her name in honour of her service
% uh to the zoo in popularising the zoo .
she was an ambassador .
so in this restaurant you can get all kinds of food
and outside the restaurant there is also % um indian food ,
there is chinese food .
so if you want to eat quickly and % uh move on
then maybe you just eat just the area just outside the restaurant .
and % uh-
much longer , okay .
okay .
okay , i see-
indian .
i see .
it 's a big area .
it 's a big area and this is right where the orangutans are
% uh swinging around the trees
% uh so you can see % uh the attractions and eat .
you do n't really waste time .
yes .
okay .
okay , so i 'll show you the other attraction .
okay .
so we also have a river safari first .
let me show you this .
river safari , yes .
this is the latest .
it 's within the zoo and you-
so when you say it 's the river safari ,
so there is a crocodile .
% uh yes , there are crocodiles .
we have crocodiles in the zoo , you can look at
within like one metre , two metres , you know .
% uh they are in an enclosure , so % uh they can not climb up the wall .
so it 's a good view .
yes .
good view .
so this river safari just opened this year ?
yes just opened .
i do n't remember exactly the date , but % uh just a few months .
% uh so it re-creates the % um famous rivers throughout the world and the forest .
okay .
yah so-
i see the amazon river , the nile
the murray , the mecan .
yes , the pandas , can you see on the right-hand side ?
yes , pandas .
they will be coming soon to singapore .
they are not quite here yet .
okay , so they do n't see any pandas right now ?
not right now if you came .
% uh you have to wait for the announcements from the % uh zoo .
management .
yes , because they have to prepare the environment .
% uh pandas are very fussy about their food .
they eat bamboo and we want to make sure that when they come here ,
they are healthy , they smile when you take photographs of them .
yes .
okay .
yah .
so % uh you take a ride along the river and when you 're taking that ride ,
the keeper the person who was with you , the guide ,
will show you specimens from the zoo .
okay .
specimen of what animal ?
like % um you know anima~
the snakes when they moult ,
they leave behind the skin .
snakes .
yeah .
so it 's impossible for us to see it because
in the forest , people would walk on it
but you would be able to see this is dried out .
because the keepers pick it up from the % uh snake enclosure
and then they dry it out .
so you 'd be able to see things like that .
skulls of animals .
okay .
skulls .
so is there a pictures of specimens here in the website ?
pictures of specimens % uh i 'm not sure .
let me try conservation .
conservation .
yah .
% oh here you get a close up of the orangutan .
orangutan .
yes .
so is this the orangutan named after the restaurant ?
% uh no .
this is not ah ming .
so i think this is another orangutan .
% uh ah ming is so famous .
we all know her photo .
we all know what she looks like .
% oh okay .
okay .
so i thought-
okay .
so this is the conservation .
and education because % uh the zoo participates in helping
not only % um wildlife in singapore
but also % uh other places in the region .
region .
yah . i % um-
yah . i % um-
we want to encourage singaporeans to be conservation conscious .
and so we have programmes for the schools where they go there and % uh-
it 's a special programme where the
special programme .
the keepers are trained to teach them to be
% uh aware of the need for a natural environment .
yah .
so this is-
two programme conservations .
so wildlife conservations breed some animals .
yes .
you can see how many we have bred .
orangutan , golden lion tamarin , % uh
% oh and even king cobra .
yes , king cobra .
% uh we have a walk-in snake enclosure .
% uh do you like to see snakes close-up ?
% hm not quite .
% uh if you do n't have a phobia of it ,
you can walk through because i have done it .
% uh the snakes are usually the tame variety
the ones that do n't move around and go after humans smell .
so they are on the trees , they are around you .
so it 's quite exciting % uh to see .
but otherwise , you do n't have to go through there , yah .
% uh we have white rhino .
okay .
yes .
rhino .
yah and-
malaysian-
malayan tapir .
yes .
malaysian-
malayan tapir you can see close to you when we visit the night safari .
night , okay .
so with this breeding programme , we exchange some of the
% uh animals where we have % uh very many with other zoos .
so-
so this wildlife reserves of singapore opens twenty four hours ?
% oh no .
% uh the zoo is for diurnal animals .
that means those are % uh active in the day .
the day , okay .
so it will close % um % uh about six i think .
five p.m .
six , about six , yes .
six .
% um and if you want to go to all three parks
like the bird park zoo and night safari ,
i suggest % uh you go to the bird park in the morning
and then you go to-
okay .
bird park in the morning .
yes .
and then you go to the zoo and
the zoo is next door to the night safari that opens only at seven thirty .
so you can eat if you 're hungry
your dinner at the zoo .
and then just a short walk about ten minutes away
across the car park
to the night safari .
or you can walk across to the night safari and there is a dining area
that they allow you in earlier .
okay .
yes .
okay .
so we can eat dinner there , they will allow us ?
yes .
yes there are restaurants there and there are % um
something like fast food , you know .
% uh burgers , % uh-
fast food .
like kfc .
% oh no , not kfc .
they both the zoo and the night safari and bird park ,
they manage their own food and beverage .
yah .
so % uh where the restaurants are concerned ,
% uh they run the restaurants themselves .
so if you see like ben and jerry 's , okay ,
then they have allowed ben and jerry 's to operate there .
okay .
operate there .
but the restaurants proper are run by wildlife reserves themselves .
okay so-
so how much % um cost for visiting the singapore zoo ?
okay , i come to the pricing in awhile .
let me bring you to the % uh night safari first .
okay .
so night safari is one of famous .
yes , it 's very famous .
have you heard about it before ?
% hm no .
okay , because it is a zoo that shows nocturnal animals .
nocturnal ?
yes .
so here you see remember the malayan tapir that you saw ?
malayan tapir , yah .
% uh they were bred in the zoo and we have quite a few of them .
they are also nocturnal and diurnal .
that means you can see them in the day and at night active .
yah .
i saw a big ride .
yes % uh-
along .
you-
the tram that is % uh painted like a tiger
it can bring you around the zoo-
% uh sorry , the night safari .
and then you-
yes .
night safari ?
yah , you get off and here the leopard trail .
leopard .
yah , you have to walk .
i see the leopard .
yah , for the giraffes you can see % um
just , you know , on the tram you can see because they 're very tall .
and the tapirs you can see because they are roaming around .
but for the leopard you have to get off and walk .
and you see this couple ?
yes .
% uh there 's actually glass between the leopards and them , yes .
and % uh we put some food nearby ,
so that they will be there where there is light .
leopard .
okay .
so some people think-
you see the background is very dark .
dark .
yes .
but you see when the leopards come-
i think the leopards also think that the couple there is
% uh nice for eating , you know .
nice .
so they come near .
% uh but the glass is very strong .
% uh so where we have animals like tigers , leopards , lions .
% um the enclosure is very secure .
tigers .
so they conserve-
so they conserve also this malayan tapir .
% uh yes .
malayan tapir because it 's indigenous to the region .
it % uh has been breeding successfully .
okay .
and % uh giraffes ,
i think giraffes we just had baby giraffe if i 'm not mistaken .
yah .
so there are some-
wow .
so you conserve-
so sometimes the tapir will come in the front of the tram
and then the tram can not move .
because it has to wait for the tapir to across the road .
yes .
to wait-
the only thing is you can not take photographs
when you 're in the night safari .
okay .
so is this % uh also the only the pictures of malayan tapir and giraffe .
so is there any pictures of animals ?
okay let-
a nocturnal animals .
% uh pictures of nocturnal animals , let me see .
leopard trail , okay .
let me show you the shows , okay ?
shows over the night ?
yes , this is creature of the night .
it 's very exciting .
so you should-
so it 's different creatures of animals .
okay here before you enter , just now you saw a
short flash of a tribal show .
tribal show ?
% oh i see .
a boa .
yah .
and yes the pictures keep changing , we ca n't control that .
yes .
% uh so you can see the elephants .
so this is a depiction of the tribes doing the dance with fire .
% uh you can volunteer for this also or-
% uh you need to very strong because that % uh-
big .
% uh python is very heavy , yes . i could n't carry it .
% uh python is very heavy , yes . i could n't carry it .
huge .
yes .
so this dance % um during the shows .
and this is the leopard hand .
% uh after the show-
is this a fire ?
yes , fire % uh-
a fire dance .
yes fires because the background is dark .
so with the fire , you know fire eating .
yes .
% uh you 'll be able to photograph very nicely .
get good photographs .
so many % uh tourist go there during the night to see some-
yes , during the night % uh you can visit the zoo
and then you just walk across the road to the night safari .
so % uh i would recommend better to eat at the night safari
because when you 're eating % uh
it 's % uh when we eat , % uh we will saw a view of this show .
yah , you see the show and if there is a long queue
people buying tickets ,
and you have n't bought your tickets yet ,
% uh you can queue up and buy the tickets first
before other tourist groups come along .
because the night safari is very popular .
okay .
popular ?
yes and % uh to control the crowd as you are walking in ,
we have % uh-
so they allow some tourist to participate
like carrying a snake ?
yes .
% uh it depends on your size , you know .
there wo~
when they ask for volunteers , you need to-
yes .
because they are so big ?
% uh that 's right , so big .
heavy .
but after the show ,
okay , i 'm gon na show you-
try and show you some pictures of the % uh-
himalayan foothills .
yah you see ?
so the whole night safari is divided into zones .
so on the right side , you can see the different zones .
so as you pass by , you 'd be able to see these animals .
okay ?
yes .
nepalese river .
so from the himalayan foothills ,
so this would be the animals you get at the himalayan foothills .
the guide on the tram will draw your attention to where they are .
okay .
okay .
so this is a rhino ?
yes .
% um this rhino looks as though he is wearing an armour .
he 's like-
these are armour plated , you know ?
like he is wearing a metal suit .
it 's a quite huge .
armour .
metal suit .
yes .
it 's a boy an old rhino ?
% uh well he 's been here quite some years .
but i do n't know his exact age .
and we have a
so what kinds of animal-
this is like a dog ?
% uh this is a wolf i think .
wolf ?
yup , wolf .
% uh probably wild dogs descended from them .
okay , from africa .
% uh this one is indians sub continents .
okay .
let see-
so africa , the african animals are very beautiful .
and they have stripes % uh colours .
yah .
is this % um
what you call it ?
i 'm afraid i do n't know the name of this particular one % uh-
but this is from africa ?
yes it 's from africa .
so % uh it 's in the area of africa that is like singapore ,
equatorial , you know .
so-
equatorial , yah .
yah , so can you see so it 's hot and humid and red .
so within that area , we also re-create the zone .
where we were % uh the first slide we saw
we try and build like cliffs for them .
they are not real cliffs but we re-create the environment , yah .
have you see the tigers ?
so-
yeah , not yet .
okay , it should be coming up on your screen .
% uh yah , i see it .
yes .
in the day zoo , you see the white tigers .
white tigers .
have you heard of-
yes , it 's a gene that is % uh mutated long ago
that they found in bangalore and then they
bred it until we have a gene pool for tigers that come out white .
so for
okay , so you only have one white tiger ?
% oh we have % uh three white tigers .
three white tigers , okay .
so there it 's at the zoo .
so you wo n't miss it .
it will be on the trail as you are walking
and so you can see their relatives here % uh in the night safari .
these are the natural-
natural ?
yah natural .
so tigers in fact % uh can still be seen in malaysia ,
our % uh neighbouring country .
but in singapore there is-
so in the malayan .
yah in the malayan region .
india and % uh malayan .
in singapore they are extinct already , huh .
we ca n't have them roaming down the streets .
malayan .
yes .
okay .
so-
so here also , so-
the malayan tapir .
% uh that 's the one that 's roaming around .
you have seen it already .
okay , i think this is the gar .
it 's a big like a buffalo .
it 's a big gar buffalo .
yah buffalo .
that 's found still in burma .
and we also have walking trails .
okay , so this night safari introduce % uh some popular animals
from different continent , different country .
yes , that 's right .
% uh yes , different countries , different continents % uh-
it sounds great because this is educational also .
yes .
i 'm trying to find you the pricing .
okay .
so this is important , the pricing .
yes .
okay .
so if you are interested in all three attractions ,
i suggest you buy a package ticket called the park hopper special .
can you see it on your screen ?
okay .
park hopper ?
yes that means you hop from park to park .
you know what i mean ?
okay .
you-
during % uh for duration of one month , thirty days ,
you can use this ticket for all three parks .
% uh but % uh we will be % uh two days only .
yes , so you will not exceed the thirty days .
two days ' vacation .
yah .
so-
so i better use % uh single purchase
or individual purchase .
that 's right .
so % uh if i scroll down a little bit you can see % uh-
see if you just visit the night safari ,
the admission plus the tram ride would be thirty two dollars .
okay .
thirty two dollars .
yes , per person .
but if you pay forty two , that means only ten dollars more
you 'll get the bird park as well .
okay .
but if you pay fifty eight ,
then you can go to the singapore zoo .
park , bird park , night safari as well as the singapore zoo .
jurong bird park .
okay , but what if % uh we will just go to jurong bird park ?
% oh jurong bird park then you just pay
the fee a little bit lower than
% uh forty two , yes .
but % uh you want to go back to jurong bird park .
i think it 's % uh bird park under twenty dollars .
forty two .
okay .
twenty dollars .
for sure .
less than that .
you want to know the exact prices ?
sure .
you 're not interested in the night safari or the zoo ?
okay .
let me see , huh .
okay .
okay , so yah i 'm right twent-
% uh eighteen dollars .
eighteen dollars .
yes that is right .
so if you take the panorail ride ,
remember i told you it 's the only panorail ride that brings you
inside the % uh bird aviary .
yes .
where you saw the birds flying around .
you add another five dollars , then it would be twenty three dollars .
% oh so it cost five dollars for us to go to aviary ?
% uh no , it doesn't-
you-
the aviary is free ,
but if you want to take the panorail ride ,
around the park it 's another five dollars .
% oh this is-
this is accessible when we go riding around the park ?
yes that 's right .
it will bring you not only to the waterfall aviary ,
but to another area where you see lorries , you know , parakeets from australia .
that are flying around , yes .
so you just get on , you get off and you show your ticket again
and you can get on again .
parakeets .
okay .
okay so i get the pricing .
so just now you remember fifty eight dollars ,
you visit three parks .
yes .
and here if you pay eighteen dollars you visit one park .
so if you do n't want to take the ride , it 's only eighteen dollars .
one park .
eighteen dollar .
so thirty two dollars when we go to % uh what do you call , the zoo , the jumong .
% uh you 're talking about all three ?
no , % uh only one .
% uh only one jurong bird park is twenty three dollars .
twenty three dollars .
but if i 'm going to use a ride ,
i 'll just pay five dollars ?
yes five dollars .
you buy the ticket ,
in other words you decide at the time that you are buying the ticket
and % uh you just show the ticket .
okay .
it 's quite interesting .
okay so i get pricing .
so how about the pricing of the siloso beach ?
siloso beach if you are just swimming ,
it 's % uh two dollars to enter the island an~
two dollars to enter the dollar-
to enter the island .
and then one dollar for % um taking the shuttle bus
from the bus bay outside % uh the island .
okay so we need to pay one dollar ?
yes .
when you come out , you do n't have to pay any money .
okay .
so you still have lots of money leftover from your thousand dollars .
but % hm is there any souvenirs that we can buy ?
% uh lots of souvenirs you can buy when you 're on
siloso beach and also when you are at the zoo .
for ex~
okay .
so at this-
% uh sorry , at the bird park .
at all the three parks and at sentosa , you can buy
lots of souvenirs .
yes .
so in % uh jurong bird park , is there an hotel for us to stay ?
% uh no not at jurong bird park , but
on sentosa there are hotels for you to stay .
as so-
so like in siloso beach ?
% uh yes .
siloso beach , you want to stay on the island ?
an hotel , yah .
okay , let me see .
because we have n't found you a hotel yet , have we ?
yes .
yes .
you 're only staying one night ,
so we have % uh lots of hotel .
let 's see .
% uh on the beach -
just one night , yah .
yah costa sands is my recommend-
costa sands .
yes , costa sands .
is this famous hotel ?
yes , % uh in fact sometimes singaporeans check-in there
during the school holidays .
because it 's just along the beach .
you can just walk down the beach .
okay .
see it 's on a hill , overlooking siloso beach .
so this is applicable for one person only or for couple or with friends ?
yes you ca~
yes , you can .
it 's like a regular resort .
you just booked the rooms there .
okay , so how much is it ?
can you see the price here ?
for-
so sixty nine ?
so eighty nine .
eighty nine singaporean dollar .
off-peak up 'til two hundred and fifteen .
so i guess it depends on the time .
okay , so this is off-peak ?
yah it depends on the time you go .
let me see whether i can get-
no , i ca n't get the rates there .
let me see .
this is for the hotel .
yes that 's for the hotel .
the pictures are appearing now .
can you see % uh the-
you only look at the one that says sentosa .
okay .
sentosa .
the third one from your left .
just wait .
i 'm trying to find the dates for you .
yah .
so downtown east ?
no downtown east is at another location .
there are four hotels manage by the group .
so when do you think you want to
yah .
so you recommend me the sentosa ?
yes definitely sentosa .
you are near to attractions and you
like i said you could visit the underwater world .
underwater world .
% uh yah , what are your dates ?
i 'm planning april five .
then we can find out then-
april -
april five , okay .
five .
that 's a monday , okay good .
monday .
april % uh .
yah .
thursday .
% oh sorry , thursday .
we were on march , yes .
so five to six you 're staying one night , is that right ?
yah , yes .
okay , so let 's check out the prices .
you have to be-
so this is i think an off-peak season .
yes off-peak because it 's the middle of the week ,
and it 's also school term .
okay .
and you see the school term ?
holiday is in % uh may , yah .
it 's in may .
so april the children are in school in singapore
so nobody checks in .
so you want to know the rate ?
holidays .
okay .
yes , sure .
okay .
for me to decide .
% uh so one room with % uh twin beds or double beds .
% oh you need to stay two nights .
shall we check out the-
you have lots of money so you can stay two nights , huh .
% ah okay .
not so .
because the maximum prices of the room is only two hundred over dollars .
two hundred .
yah , so you said you have a thousand to spend .
okay .
yes .
so can you see the pricing on your screen ?
yah , % uh deluxe room cost two hundred twenty nine singaporean dollars .
yes it 's daily rate so it would be two to nine .
let say two thirty times two ,
% uh four hundred and sixty dollars .
okay .
but kampung hut is much cheaper .
yes much cheaper .
than deluxe room .
yah yes .
yah but this is applicable for two nights .
yes a minimum of two nights .
okay .
let me think about it .
so kampung hut .
'cause i 'm with my friend .
okay .
so-
this kampung hut cost one hundred nine singaporean dollars .
yes .
it 's % uh less than half the price .
this applicable only during off-peak season .
% uh it 's during the time that you want to go ,
that is the price .
okay .
the kampung .
so this is for two to three nights .
but we can only stay one night .
so is there-
are you able to extend your stay ?
because one night is not really enough time for singapore .
and you have a lot of money for singap~
no room .
okay , but-
but i better ask my friend about this , yah .
okay .
but i 'm quite interested with this .
% uh while-
yah because you can stay there , you can spend a whole day at the beach
and visit the underwater world i was telling you about .
okay .
yes .
% um i 'm adding up the cost .
% uh so twenty three for your bird park ,
% uh twenty five for underwater world .
three dollars to enter sentosa .
okay .
underwater world .
then one dollar to ride a bus .
yah well including the one dollar is three dollars .
okay .
that 's why i say % uh you have lots of money .
yah so i better consult first with my friend .
yes , huh .
of course we wo n't do the bookings now .
% uh no .
so i 'll tell him about the package-
about the two night stay .
% uh actually we 're planning only one night .
okay .
okay so-
so you can see how much money you are spending .
yah .
so i 'm better consult them first .
okay .
okay .
and maybe we add-in-
let say it 's a big % um figure ,
you will get your change back for taking the % uh mass rapid transit
to travel around by train and the bus .
so allow thirty dollars per person .
per person .
yes .
okay , so i 'll better check it first , okay ?
okay .
thank you so much for-
so-
yes .
so thank you for introducing me to singapore .
you 're welcome .
okay .
and i hope you 'll come back and visit % uh singapore for more days .
yes .
okay , thank you .
thank you very much .
thank you .
bye .
bye bye amil .
bye bye .
bye bye .
hello .
hello , good afternoon .
good afternoon .
i 'm jeanne , guide number two
from singapore .
may i know your name ?
i 'm jen cantos and i 'm participant number thirty nine .
number thirty nine .
jen is it j e n ?
yes .
yes , that 's correct .
okay .
% uh how can i help you , jen ?
% uh , i have n't been to singapore and i heard that it 's a great place .
% uh i would like to ask you for % uh suggestions of the places that i should
% uh be visiting there .
and by the way % uh i have-
my budget is around one thousand singaporean dollars ,
and i plan to stay there for two days .
% um i 'm not quite sure if my budget would be enough .
could you give the suggestions , so i could be able to maximise my budget ?
your budget is more than enough for-
because two days is only one night .
so you can in fact stay two nights .
% oh that 's great .
that 's great .
% uh but i need to know who are you travelling with please .
% um i plan to tag my friend along , so there would be-
so you 're bringing your friend , okay .
how many of % uh-
sorry .
so two of you only , is it ?
yah .
yes , correct .
and it 's a girl you are travelling with ?
yes .
okay , and you are in your twenties i assume ?
actually i 'm in my thirties .
% oh you sounded a very young thirty then , okay .
thank you .
well , you 're still young at thirty , so it 's not a problem , huh .
% uh can i know % um what are your preferences ?
what do you normally enjoy % uh back home ?
yah .
% uh i like to-
% uh well , i live in the city , so i would like to spend some time
in a place where there is greenery and stuff .
could % uh-
i know there are places like that in singapore .
% uh you want to stay in places where 's , there is greenery , % uh garden setting , is it ?
yes .
well , we have resort hotels on sentosa island .
but % uh for two nights , it might be a little bit % uh costly , unless you stay % uh on the beach front .
% uh we have a more affordable hotel on the beach front that i can recommend to you ,
so you can walk around the island and enjoy the beaches as well .
is that suitable for you ?
% hm i think that it would be great .
but % uh although i 'm really not limiting myself to % uh those kinds of places .
i would also like to see the city itself ,
all the % uh structures , the buildings and the city lights .
that would be great also .
okay .
okay , the city lights % uh the architecture is very % uh accessible from the island ,
because % uh this island is off the south of singapore and it 's also % uh , you know ,
connected by train and by road .
so , let me show you a map of singapore ,
so that you have an idea of locations .
okay .
okay .
and then you can % uh make up your mind if you like that or not .
alright .
so can you get the map on your screen ?
yes , i 'm seeing it .
okay .
so i 'm trying to enlarge it for you .
so here you see singapore with its neighbouring country , malaysia
to the north of us .
so we are an island surrounded by water .
and the island i 'm suggesting you stay is right down south .
% uh sort of triangular shape .
if you see bukit merah on the map , can you see it ?
where is it ?
where-
in the south .
in the middle of the island right at the bottom .
alright .
alright .
you saw that ?
yes .
okay , across from there , there are two islands .
and the bigger island is sentosa island .
alright .
okay , so now you can see it ?
yes .
now , the city and all these other lines , did you see ?
% uh these are roads .
and later i 'll show you a map of the subway system .
alright .
which is also integrated with the bus system % uh at bus interchanges at there .
there are lots of people using public transport .
so it 's very easy to move around in singapore .
okay .
so aside from the bus , % uh i can also take the train ?
yah .
yes , % uh in fact i suggest you take the train because it 's faster and it 's % uh-
is it cheaper ?
% uh actually travel is by distance .
so , by distance the trains are more expensive to set up .
so it would be a little bit more expensive for journeys .
% uh short journeys that you do in town will just cost you % uh a dollar twenty
if you go little bit further out .
and bus journeys % uh will be under a dollar .
% uh this is just a rough guide .
let me show you where % uh the airport of singapore is and with the train connections .
so i 'll show you the mrt map .
okay .
% oh okay .
% oh okay .
alright .
so mrt is the mass rapid transit .
and that is the name of our % uh subway which is also above ground in certain parts .
and the lrt you saw on the map is a light rail to support it .
that one i do n't think you 'll be taking .
it leads people right up to the doorstep .
so-
can you see % uh number three on the map ?
number three , yes .
yes on the right .
yes .
so this is the eastern tip of the island .
and that is our airport , international airport .
so if you come in here and you go down to the basement ,
there is an office that will sell you the tickets for the subway .
and , you can put value in it .
in fact , you have to put value in it , so that % uh as you use the subway and the passes ,
the value is deducted .
okay .
so they a tour advantages , you do n't have to worry about the fare
and you also don't-
you also get a discount .
every time you connect the journey % uh you 'll get a discount .
so it makes it very attractive .
% oh okay .
so for all the places i 'm seeing now ,
% uh i just have to use % uh one card .
% uh i do not have to change cards for every
% uh let say for every area or-
yes , that 's right .
no , you do n't have to .
okay .
okay .
% uh the card is called the ez-link card .
ez-link ?
yah , it is the size of a credit card .
okay .
and it 's a contactless card .
so you just tap it at the sensor when you are entering the stations .
and tap it at % uh when you come out , the gate will open when you are on the subway .
and if you are in the bus , you must remember to tap it when you get off the bus .
because otherwise , % uh the system will assume that you 've taken the journey right up to the end .
because they are not reading anything on your card .
so you tap in and you tap out .
so that 's what you need to do .
okay .
okay , huh .
so that is very easy % uh and you can get the cards .
% uh well for me at the airport for you is the most convenient .
but if % uh you suddenly travel all over singapore ,
you have used up all the value .
% uh you can go to a seven eleven store that 's open twenty four hours ,
and you just put in a little bit more money .
% oh okay .
% oh so it 's , so there is an extra charge if i 'll % uh i 'm going to buy it seven eleven ?
no , it 's not extra , you 're just putting value into the card .
so % uh this makes it convenient , because seven eleven stores are all over singapore .
% uh even at petrol stations .
so you-
if you should run out of money in the card .
but usually i suggest that people % uh put in more than enough and then when they leave ,
go back to the officer and get your refund % uh before you leave .
so you do n't have to worry about it .
% uh you can also use the card for sightseeing .
i did it once with a friend .
i use the trains to go all around singapore % uh and once we 're out of the city , it is above ground ,
so you can see all around you .
yah , the only thing is we came back to her hotel so which was % uh it showed on the card
that we had % uh travelled only maybe one-stop away , because we stop one-stop away from her hotel .
and we have to pay two dollars surcharge .
this is to discourage people using the system % uh to make friends , chit chat inside ,
you know , the train station so 'cause they are very comfortable .
so that is the only thing , yah .
and you can do that to because i think two dollars is the very % uh small fee to pay , right ?
% oh , that 's great .
okay .
yah .
yah .
% um so where do you want to live in singapore ?
where do you want to stay ?
% uh , so you want a beach hotel or you want to stay in an ethnic area ?
% uh can you explain me what can i see in an ethnic area ?
okay , ethnic area we have two % uh that is % uh very easily % uh connectable for you ,
you can from there to other places .
one is chinatown and one is little in~
% oh okay .
so in chinatown you get more % uh chinese food , souvenirs .
% uh in little india you can have a big variety of indian food , % uh and you can visit a lot of hindu temples .
% uh in % uh little india in fact we have % uh buddhist temple and also a church there .
a few churches in fact % uh within the area
because we are multi-cultural and multi-religious .
also in chinatown , at the heart of chinatown , in fact it 's one of older hindu temples
which is also a national monument .
and our oldest chinese temple is there and it 's all within walking distance .
% oh that 's great .
but you wo n't get your greenery around there , you know .
so if you want a greenery , you want a resort view , then it would be sentosa island .
% hm , so % um if i 'm to compare which would be cheaper between the two places if % uh-
when i speaking about hotels ?
okay where price is concerned , % uh little india and chinatown has % uh lower priced hotels .
because in their locations the rents are lower than in the island .
% uh so on the island i think about two hundred dollars ,
you should be able to get a hotel , a decent size hotel .
which is also a good rate .
in chinatown , well , you do n't want a dormitory , do you ?
where you share the bed with other people ?
% oh no .
yah , so if you want to have a room to yourself ,
about eighty to a hundred sixty % uh you should be able to get a decent size % uh room in chinatown .
that 's per night , right ?
yes , per night yes .
will that also include meals ?
% uh meals it depends on the hotel .
some of them do not provide meals , because all around , where the hotel is , there are food outlets .
so sometimes it not worth the while to provide the meal .
so it actually depends on the individual hotel .
% oh alright .
and how about the hotels in the other area ?
in little india you can get hotels in this price range and even cheaper .
so % uh what sort of food do you enjoy ?
% uh i 'm really not into the exotic food , so i 'd like to-
place just that % um safe food .
not the exotic ones .
safe food so-
in-
% uh safe food , so do you have chinese food in your country ?
% uh so-
% uh yes .
so % uh i 'm more familiar with chinese food than indian food .
so-
yah , indian food the only problem is if you take too much chili ,
and some people can find it too hot on the tongue .
so-
yes , i 'm not into that .
so i think chinese food is safer for me .
okay , so we will check out the hotels in chinatown .
and we 'll show you a variety and with their prices .
and so you can have a look .
alright
chinatown is busy day and night but they have other % uh
they have hotels along the small streets , they have hotels along the main road .
so i can tell you from the location whether it 's a quieter part of chinatown or not .
% uh we also have very good class boutique hotels in chinatown .
and here you can soak up the atmosphere .
okay .
% uh if you 're thinking of regular size hotels ,
you know , the normal idea of hotel ,
it would be furama city centre .
can you see % uh on the screen ?
where is it ?
furama , yes i can see it .
yes , furama city centre .
so eu tong seng street is one of the main road in chinatown .
% uh below that you see another road called keong saik road ,
and that is a small lane off the major roads of chinatown and it 's on the quieter side of chinatown .
also bukit pasoh and here you can see the hotel price it is also like a
business hotel rate , % huh .
yes .
it 's quite expensive .
yes , so i think % uh we will not consider that , right ?
what do you think ?
no .
okay , i thought you would like the money for shopping or some other thing , huh .
% uh we have also new bridge road which is also along the main road , % uh
santa grand hundred and forty eight .
and santa grand has two hotels , one they call it chinatown hundred and forty eight
and lai chun yuen which is hundred and forty five .
so it 's about same price .
yes .
lai chun yuen is % uh closer right into the heart of chinatown .
even better we have this one along the side street , the inn at temple street .
can you see it ?
yes .
% uh that 's only one eight .
and below a hundred , keong saik hotel .
it takes his name from the road .
% uh the quieter side of town .
on the quieter side also at the bottom we have scarlet hotel but you can see the price it 's two six five .
it is a-
it 's luxury class .
yes , it 's luxury class yah .
so % uh porcelain hotel is on the main road .
so % uh maybe a little bit busier when you come out .
so it 's your choice whether you want to be just off the main street or you would like to be in the-
on the main road , because off the main street , you just walk out and five minutes ,
you 're into the shopping area , into where the restaurants , the cafés , the street side shopping is .
off the main road is also maybe three , four minutes away .
% uh i prefer the off the main road .
off the main road .
okay , let 's have a look again .
okay .
so , furama city centre is off because that is main road .
okay , off the main road we have i think at % uh the upper end is the hotel nineteen twenty nine
and it 's very popular , it 's very trendy .
it was one of the first hotels in chinatown converted out of places where people use to shop .
% uh start to shop downstairs and live upstairs .
% uh we also have a new majestic , that 's three hundred , so we forget about that , right ?
yes .
% uh we have-
the most affordable here , the attractive price is the keong saik hotel .
% uh and the other one is the inn at temple street .
% uh quieter side of chinatown is keong saik street .
% uh temple street you are actually % uh in the heart of
% uh where people eat and % uh shop .
so it 's like you go downstairs and there are shops all around .
i think it-
that 's a good place to stay in .
okay , so you want to be in the heart of the action but not along the main road , right ?
yes , correct .
okay , so let me write this down , the inn at temple street .
and the name temple street is because there is one of our oldest hindu temples % uh over there .
so let me show you .
there you go .
if you want to book , alright ?
% uh when are you deciding to come ?
% um probably on the first week of april .
first week of april ?
yes .
% uh i think prices withhold , yes .
let me see .
is it the same set of prices ?
% uh it would goes up a little bit in april , % huh .
% uh thirty first of march , the price is one eight .
one hundred thirty , yah this one .
yah , one hundred so about twelve dollars more .
% um that 's okay .
% uh that 's okay .
% uh you look at the price here .
so whether you are by yourself or with your friend , it 's the same price
a hundred and thirty dollars .
so you can afford two nights .
yes .
right ?
yes , so that would be two hundred and sixty dollars .
but % uh there is no breakfast , you ha~
% eh it 's not a problem with breakfast , because you can always % uh just walk out as i said .
and you can have breakfast over there .
okay .
let me show you some % uh pictures and images of the hotel .
so that you have a better % uh idea of where you are staying , % huh .
so this is the outside , the facade of the hotel .
and this is the lobby .
so it 's quite homely , is n't it ?
yah .
but the % uh the facade , is it that an old building ?
yes , all the hotels along this little streets are converted shop houses .
% uh and well this may not be a shop house itself , it could be a clubhouse or whatever .
but % uh for the majority of the hotels , they are made up of buildings
where peopl used to live upstairs and they run a business downstairs .
and it 's like it 's the same as your hotel , although i have n't check up on this particular address .
so the hoteliers % un undertook a conservation of the building by restoring it and-
so the inside was changed .
% uh previously % uh there was one staircase leading down .
and there were very-
it was very cramp .
there would be little cubicles where people live .
but , here you see it 's like a regular small boutique hotel .
so instead of the shop , you have a lobby , your reception area % uh as you enter .
yah , it looks classy though .
yes , very classy .
so it 's quite a bargain for a hundred and thirty dollars , right ?
and from that little table and chair , they have tried to put some of the older furniture
which has become very popular nowadays , % huh .
so you can see the room has got a bathroom attached ?
right , so this is acceptable for you ?
yes .
okay , % uh would you like to see some of the food you can get ?
sure .
% uh in chinatown since you are not getting breakfast .
% uh what we like to eat in singapore which is % uh nutritious and tasty is called kaya toast .
% uh kaya is-
kaya ?
yah .
yes , kaya k a y a .
% oh okay .
it is % uh-
% uh i do n't know whether you can call it a jam .
it is made of % uh coconut .
% uh you know the flesh the coconut ?
we squeeze out the juice and then we put in eggs and % uh natural fragrance called pandans leaves .
yes .
so , it is cooked and it 's stirred constantly and in the old days this was done by hand .
i do n't know even now whether they have a machine to do it .
you can see it there % uh a shop that is very well known called yakun to-
kaya toast , % um % hm .
yah .
% uh let me show you the picture here .
yah .
% uh can you see here spread the word ?
so they have made the recipe out of % uh coconut milk , sugar , eggs and pandan .
sugar , eggs , fragrant panda , % um % hm .
so it 's natural , no artificial colouring or flavouring .
the flavour is from the leaves .
and yakun is one of the most places .
in fact , i just had % uh their breakfast this morning .
and here it 's like a little café ,
nothing fancy but very affordable .
so you can put kaya on it or you can just put butter .
and we also like sugar on the toast
or cheese .
so instead of ham and eggs , or bacon and eggs ,
i think this is more traditional for us and maybe you want to try it .
% um % hm , you 're making me hungry now actually .
yah , lucky i had lunch .
% uh here the bottom and they do it perfectly .
soft boiled eggs , % um % hm .
the eggs .
and what we do is we take it with dark % uh soy sauce .
you know soy sauce made from soya bean ?
so the dark kraft is very thick .
they use quality % uh dark soy sauce and if you like you can put in a lot of pepper .
yes .
yes .
% uh i like to swallow the yolk whole and that 's , yes .
so i eat the whites and then i swallow the whole yolk , it 's very yummy .
but-
.
careful on that though .
% oh yes , well , i do n't eat that everyday , % uh just a treat once in a while .
and % uh you-
so to finish up , you can have the kaya on toast .
so you have it 's like a desert , you know what i mean ?
so you have the savoury eggs and then you have the sweet toast .
and there 's ice cream toast ?
yes , ice cream toast .
% uh that would be maybe in the afternoon .
when it 's a bit warm so singaporeans get off the street , they want something to pamper themselves
without spending too much , so they will % uh ask for ice cream toast , kaya toast or butter sugar .
have you tried that ?
butter sugar toast ?
you butter the toast bread and then you sprinkle sugar on it .
it 's not good for your diet but yummy .
i 'm not going to have that everyday anyway , so-
that 's okay .
no , you-
yah .
just two days , you know % uh .
% uh yakun outlets are all over singapore and you can find them in shopping centres ,
you can find them along the roadsides , you know , where you 're shopping .
% uh because it 's a chain .
the family has % uh opened up many outlets all over-
yah , so % uh what else would you like me to find for you % uh-
% uh since i 'm still % uh undecided with-
although the inn you showed me a while ago is % uh-
that looks like a good deal .
but % uh i would also like to have other options .
% uh what 's the other place that you % uh say-
so you want the hotels in little india ?
no , % um the other i think the beachfront hotel ?
hotels are-
okay , the beach one ?
alright , the sentosa hotels .
okay .
sentosa has % uh one hotel that is not very expensive on the island .
and they also have resorts style very classy hotels .
so there is a choice .
in singapore we have lots of choices .
so you can always budget accordingly .
so that 's the view of the island and the beach is on one side of the island .
so % uh on the list there , you can see some % uh resort hotels .
you do n't want resort hotels , so you can % uh scroll down and find one % uh sentosa beach hotel .
let 's try and get the hotels again , okay .
it 's % uh loading now .
okay .
let me find it for you .
okay .
i see that there are no prices included in this page .
okay , there are two we can look at .
there is costa sands and there is also siloso beach .
so it 's on a popular beach with many attractions .
and here we have costa sands .
wait .
you 're having a view of the place ?
yes , i can see it now .
okay .
so costa sands , let 's look at the rates .
% uh let me see .
can you see up here ?
yes .
% uh just on the side bar , it 's eighty nine dollars to two hundred and fifteen dollars , yes .
fifteen .
so let me try and find it for you .
okay .
the two hundred over dollars a night would be i think a hotel room .
and there , can you see it here % uh .
they have another hotel elsewhere .
so we have to make sure that we put you on sentosa island .
so you said april , do you have a date for april ?
could you click the calendar for me ?
i do not have a calendar .
okay .
okay , we get the april month for you .
okay .
april -
% uh we have march there , we 'll get down to april .
april .
yes , okay .
so the first of april is % uh sunday .
so % um ,
okay .
if it 's two nights you 'll stay till the third , is that right ?
or do you want to go another day in april ?
how about april seventh ?
which da~
april seventh , okay , we 'll try for april seventh .
so it 's a weekend also .
april seventh and departing on the ninth , is that right ?
right .
so it 's saturday till monday .
so you have the weekend there .
% oh i 'm sorry , they have no room .
no room .
to bad .
to ba~
if you pick % uh a weekday , i think you 'll definitely get a room .
how about % um , could you show me the calendar again ?
there is a , the calendar and then you can see the actual day you want to have .
how about april five ?
april five that 's a thursday .
april five , yes .
five in-
and the seventh out , okay .
five to seven .
% oh no .
okay .
there are no room , % oh no rooms .
sorry , i looked at it , okay .
% uh i think your other friends have booked it already .
let 's try another date ?
do you want to get , okay .
% uh , wait .
you try another date further down in april .
how about , yes the eleventh ?
eleventh to thirteenth .
and we see whether you have luck this time .
so here , can you see the rates ?
yes .
one eighty nine .
what 's a kampong hut ?
% uh kampong hut is a small structure , it supposed to % uh resemble the
% uh but you see the deluxe room , that 's a deluxe room that you are seeing over there .
okay .
so that is the difference .
some people prefer that % uh they go to the % uh kampong hut
because of the nostalgic % uh feelings that it gives them .
but is it air-conditioned ?
no ?
% uh you have a look at it , the rooms have definitely air-conditioned
for the % uh one that 's a hundred and eighty nine dollars .
kampong hut forty nine dollars , i 'm not sure .
% uh let 's see , okay ?
because forty nine dollars % uh is a little too attractive let say for a beachfront .
and also some people % uh they like to have the sea breezes .
i used to do that when i was % uh in school .
so you open the windows and you can hear the water ,
you can hear % uh the crickets in the background , you know .
so if you have air conditioning , you are actually shutting out the natural environment .
% uh you have a point there .
yes , so % uh for me because i like to go to as natural setting as possible ,
so % uh the kampong hut would be very attractive for me .
% uh i mean if i were the visitor .
but if you prefer creature comforts , you need your air conditioning ,
then % uh the hotel room will be more the regular type of hotel that you will be able to enjoy .
so % uh you can see that % uh there 's a swimming pool .
but of course i think you-
perhaps want to swim in the sea .
the sea is very % uh calm ,
it 's a sheltered bay .
and for some people if they do n't like the salt water , then they can also use the pool .
the pool .
yes , you can use both .
i think this is the kampong hut here .
okay .
could you click back ?
yes .
so here it is .
they did n't mention air conditioning .
it seems like it may be .
i 'll try and find out for you .
i do n't know why it does n't say whether it 's air-conditioned or not .
but you see it 's all closed in .
you get what i mean ?
so % um
probably it is .
yes , probably it is .
% uh so % uh you still get your air conditioning , but i think the size of the place
is perhaps a little bit smaller .
especially for two people ?
% uh , no .
i think two people , if you 're not gon na spend a lot of time in the room , it should not be a problem .
okay , it 's air-conditioned .
% uh you get-
what you get are two double-decker beds .
% uh and you also-
okay , the only difference and this is the catch , you-
there 's a common toilet and shower facilities nearby .
% oh so it's-
we have to share .
so you'll-
yes , you have to share .
so in fact , the room is n't that small because you can have two double-decker beds
and that means if you came with three other friends ,
you 'll still be able to stay there .
% um hm .
so some people on tight budget , that 's what they 'll do .
they save their money for shopping or eating .
but the only problem is we have to share the comfort rooms .
yes , that is right .
that 's why , you know , the price is so low .
it is even under fifty dollars .
so what is your preference ?
% uh what-
the % hm-
i 'll go with the deluxe room .
you 're going with the deluxe room , okay .
so this is the deluxe room , % uh very classy , % huh ?
there .
so here you see the hotel .
so there 's the neighbouring carts .
okay , so the deluxe room -
% uh let 's have a look at the rates for the deluxe room .
% uh the deluxe room then would give you more space , % uh more % uh comfort level .
and you also feel more like a tourist , okay .
we have to find out if it 's available .
was it eleventh ?
what date was it your-
eleventh .
yah , eleventh to thirteenth , okay .
yes , eleventh , thirteenth .
eleventh to thirteenth .
okay , here you are , it 's a hundred and eighty nine dollars .
so that would be the standard deluxe .
that 's okay .
% uh that 's okay .
so i can see you like some luxury .
we can put it at let 's say hundred and ninety dollars times two ,
% um that 's % uh three hundred and eighty dollars for your rooms , alright ?
and so then you 'll be on the beachfronts and there are forest walks that you can do there , okay ?
so we forget about little india and chinatown .
yes .
so what about sightseeing , what are your preferences ?
what sort of things that would you like to see whilst you 're here ?
% uh , are there botanical gardens in singapore ?
% oh yes , % uh we have a botanic gardens that is very well-known .
and sentosa also has greenery all around .
% uh i 'll get you the information on the botanic gardens .
it 's the singapore botanic gardens .
okay .
and % uh it 's a huge place and most people % uh
when they do n't have too much time , they visit the orchids , okay .
because the-
within the orchid enclosure we have many-
orchids that are in bloom , that are on display .
we also have a little forest % uh right near to where the orchids are .
and it 's a very % uh , what should i say ?
very comfortable forest because you can walk on a pathway and % uh you see
huge trees over a hundred and fifty years old right next to you
but % uh you do n't have to step on mud .
so it 's quite comfortable .
and we have also a ginger garden within the area .
and these areas are very near to each other .
so ginger 's % uh consist of eight families and some of them
% uh they are grown for ornamental reasons .
so besides the ginger that you use for cooking ,
we have also , you know , colourful flowers that people use to decorate hotel rooms ,
% uh their own houses if they have a big % uh living room .
and so here you can see the gardens .
% uh you see the band stand there , that dates ?
right over a hundred years .
i do n't know , yes .
so we do n't have a band playing there now because it 's too small .
but , here you can see some of the attractions .
% uh let me show you , okay , the hours , the visiting hours .
% uh actually i know , it opens % uh five a.m . in the morning .
% oh admission is free .
so-
% oh yes , to the gardens ,
it 's free .
that 's good news .
a very good news .
you just have to pay to see the orchids .
and % uh you-
because that 's special , that 's very special , yah .
so i 'm talking about the national orchid garden .
it 's five dollars .
and this section closes at seven .
but you could go jogging around the garden till twelve midnight .
till twelve midnight , % um % hm .
yes , % uh and you can go for romantic walk , you know , if you had bought your boyfriend along .
% uh but you and-
i 'm bringing a girl .
% uh % huh you can bring a girl .
maybe when you 're walking you 'll meet some ha~
a lot of handsome guys , you know , that live near the area ?
they go there and they jog and % uh
so it 's nice also to have a look at other things besides the flowers there .
and we have , you know , senior citizens it 's only one dollar .
this is only if you see the orchids .
interesting .
% uh if you are visiting the forest , the ginger garden , % uh ecological garden ,
it is all free of charge , yah .
% um , and your friend is an adult .
so you can not visit jacob ballas .
it 's a children 's garden .
% uh , okay .
yes .
% oh okay , if you are serious about botany , there is a very good library , okay .
% uh we can-
this part of the gardens , you can approach by bus % uh and just walk there .
% uh to this area .
it 's very easy to visit .
now , let me show you the attractions .
we have there also % um very old tree .
% uh let me go to the tanglin halt .
okay , this is the map of the area .
so if you were to visit the gardens , % uh okay .
you could either stop your bus over here at tanglin gates ,
and then you walk in through a lovely garden here and then there is the lake
and you can carry on , you can see the swans in the lake .
then you can carry on and % uh further down the walk would be the orchid enclosure ,
as well as the % uh ginger orchids .
if you want to see sculptures , you walk the other way .
we have some sculptures and we have huge % uh heritage trees .
can you see here this one called ceiba pentandra ?
that is actually the cotton tree , we call it the kapok tree .
and if you are lucky-
kapok .
yes , it's-
i do n't know if you are familiar with this when babies were born , we did n't want to give them polyester
filled pillows , so there were people who collect % uh the cotton
that is inside the pod and then it 's save up to make a pillow
for the baby .
and the tree is very huge there and many people like to take photographs there .
so today it 's one of our heritage tree , so we try to protect it .
% uh further down is another tall tree here also a heritage tree .
and if you go around the corner , % uh can you see vanda 'miss joaquim ' ?
% uh that would be where the % uh ginger garden and the orchids is located , okay .
okay , so it 's nice to get in from there and then % uh you can see all the other parts of the gardens ,
and then this is the ginger garden .
can you see burkill gates ?
on the left ?
yes .
yah , so-
lots of colourful % uh plants there .
and we also have useful gingers % uh turmeric , % uh the normal ginger that you eat .
and as you proceed up % uh it 's a very short road
inside the gardens .
you see national orchid garden at the top ?
so that is where we have % uh the orchids .
and it 's a three-hectare site , you need about forty five minutes to visit the orchids alone to enjoy .
quite big .
to take pho~
% oh yes , so % uh it 's because there's-
it 's so interesting here , i think three quarters or an hour is the minimum to enjoy this .
so maybe if you provide % um three hours to go to the gardens ,
and , you know , you can also walk the forest .
the forest is just nearby .
and then you would have seen maybe only half of the gardens .
yah , so this is the biggest garden , the oldest and the most popular in singapore .
so ,
yah ,
it 's also very chea~
yes , because it 's free .
it 's only just-
it 's free , yes % uh .
% uh i 'll show you some heritage trees or they have don't-
let me see if there are pictures .
% oh this is just may be for scientist to know % uh the size of the tree and also where it 's located .
yah , so no pictures , not so interesting , okay .
so botanic gardens is a must see , yes ?
if you enjoy % uh gardens .
but we do n't have a sector on-
let me see .
they do n't feature the forest .
let me try .
% oh bukit timah is not .
it 's not the attraction but let 's have a look at bukit timah .
yes .
okay here if you are interested in herbs and spices .
% uh it 's a further walk down to another section of the gardens and we have another lake there .
so here it 's % uh what we call an economic garden .
you can see nuts and beverages crops .
because originally when the british came , the gardens was used to experiment to see which
spice trees , what useful plants could be grown here .
do-
so we've-
do they sell goods there ?
yes , % uh the best-
nuts and fruits .
% uh not nuts and fruits but % uh souvenirs like-
but within the national orchid garden % uh we have a company called risis .
it i~
the first company to come up with the technology to encase a real flower and % uh preserve it .
so , % uh by some scientific method they have etched gold to the % uh real orchid flower .
and you can use it as a pendant or a brooch .
and of course that shop has other souvenirs as well .
but the spices % uh the herbs is more for educational purposes .
yah .
i see .
we have % uh plant sales but i think the gardens gets nurseries to sell their plants there .
so we also do research here .
so i think they not so keen on the commercial side of the business .
yah .
so this is the gardens for you .
what else would you like to see in singapore ?
alright .
i think that would be all .
is that all or you want to have % uh other areas % uh whether it 's museums or natural places ?
i can find for you .
% uh how about zoos ?
zoos , okay , we try and get the zoo for you .
the zoo is part of a three attractions that is run by wildlife reserves in singapore .
so , here i 'm gon na open up and let you see .
also within the zoo % uh bird park and night safari which are the three attractions .
they are like gardens because of the landscaping .
but the landscaping is more towards the natural environment of the inhabitants .
so , like here were plants % um fruit trees for the birds ,
and tall shady trees and where the same trees are found in africa and can survive in singapore ,
we also got them .
this is % uh waterfall aviary , it 's a walk in aviary .
that means you actually can -
you can be inside with the birds , you know what i mean ?
walk in , % um % hm .
really ?
yes .
so % uh you can feel very close-up to them .
it 's not like you 're looking at the cage .
the birds are free flying .
and we also have the largest waterfall % uh that is man-made
in this area which is also good for photography .
and if you are tired , you do n't want to walk ,
you can take % uh panorail which is an air-conditioned train within the park .
and as far as i know , it 's the only panorail that enters a bird aviary .
so when you get off the tram , you 're already inside this aviary .
and you can see the birds feeding , you can % uh wait .
if you map your tour according to the feeding times , you can feed them .
yah .
so this is the day attraction .
% uh you want to have % uh the % uh zoo , is that right ?
yes .
okay .
so the zoo is also a day attraction .
in other words it closes in the evening on about six o'clock .
and here we have-
have you see this creature bef~
nudist colony .
yes , i have n't seen it myself but i must go there just to see it .
% uh they call it naked , i think-
mole rats .
rats usually have fur , but this one does n't have fur .
and the teeth are used for tunnelling .
this is just one of the attractions there .
have you seen orangutans before ?
% uh , i think only at national geographic .
national geographic , yes .
well , here you can see % uh they are free-ranging , in other words ,
% uh up on the trees , they are swinging around and one of the highlights is % uh if you have breakfast -
so is it safe ?
it 's very safe because these are breed in the zoo .
and % uh they are tamed % uh .
, okay , so the restaurant you saw is air-conditioned if you are too hot you can go in and eat .
but it 's glass all around , so you can look out and you can see the orangutans .
their free-ranging area is right there .
so for twenty nine dollars % uh in the morning if you go ,
so the outside area is ah meng terrace named after an ambassador
% uh who was an a female orangutan called ah meng .
and you 'd be able to
have breakfast and at the same time you can-
after your breakfast , take a photograph with the orangutan .
they actually pose for pictures ?
% uh they do n't really pose , they are sitting there .
and % uh i have n't seen an orangutan smile .
% uh but-
yes , i know .
% uh if you are lucky there is a baby and then you can see % uh the mother and the baby .
so , if their baby is there , do n't touch the baby .
you know mothers are naturally protective of the babies .
just kidding
yes .
so this is bigger picture .
so , the orangutan is nearby but it does n't care for your jam and rolls .
and it will have fruits like % uh bananas , durian .
do you know durian ?
yes .
they 're smelly but it 's very delicious , % uh very creamy and it will be eating that .
so after breakfast , you 'll be invited to take photos with the orangutan .
and they also now bring out other animals out % uh with their handlers .
so if you want to go near , % uh touch or take photograph ,
% uh you check with the handler and the handler will know the mood of the animal at that time .
usually they bring the ones that are very % uh visitor friendly .
so this is one of the things that you can see % uh at the zoo in the day time , yah .
% uh i 'll show you % uh the shows , let me see huh .
no , let me see the animal appearance .
okay .
there you go .
this is a very handsome python called the golden python .
and it 's with the handler , so % uh if you-
% uh do you like snakes ? or are you-
% uh do you like snakes ? or are you-
i 'm afraid of them .
so , you 're afraid them , you need not touch it but you-
yes .
it 's good to take this opportunity to just feel it , it 's very smooth , it 's cold .
as long as it will not attack me , that 's okay .
that 's fine for me .
no , they wo n't attack you , the keeper is there and in this picture you can see it is holding up ,
you know the snake quite well .
% um sometimes at the visitor sites , other visitor sites outside the zoo ,
we have % uh snake charmers who have their own cobras .
% uh and if you are afraid of touching the head , you can touch the tail .
no , that-
no , that 's a cobra .
that 's a different story .
that 's what some of my tourist do .
% uh sorry not cobra , i said the wrong thing .
phy- .
yes , no cobra , sorry .
we used to have what we called the black mamba that looks like a cobra ,
but they stop using that because the tourist % uh were frightened .
but % uh the mamba it 's actually a tame variety which the people bring in .
but at the zoo % uh they have the golden pythons ,
whose % uh habit is only to wind themselves around % uh
you know , if they catch something they want to it , they wind themselves around it .
but you know this size especially , if they do say wind themselves around your hand ,
the keeper will be there to remove it .
so it 's not a problem , yah .
% oh yah .
% uh let 's see if we can see other attractions .
here we go .
so you are looking at all the animals .
this is a family of orangutans .
we have crocodiles and monitor lizards .
and this is the australian outback .
okay let through .
these are the more exciting animals .
here we have the leopards and % uh we also have here elephants .
asian elephants who do a show and you can feed , you just pay a few dollars for the food , okay .
okay .
% uh fragile forest is where you can see-
see this one you have to go to madagascar to see , so , yah .
yah , % um % hm .
this is also like the walking aviary .
it is a forest that you walk-in to .
there 's a huge net around it .
it 's a big area and as you 're walking around , you can take photographs of these animals , yah .
and these are fellows from africa , % uh baboons , himalayan hamadryas baboons .
we also have polar bears and there 's a polar bear show .
so , this one looks like the singaporean polar bear who was born here .
so he has air-conditioned surroundings , yah .
so these are some of the animals you see at zoo .
so does it attract you or ?
yes , very much .
% hm yes .
yes . % uh ,
okay show one more to tempt you further .
this is % uh the most popular attraction because it is very rare .
it is a white tiger and it 's due to a mutant gene % uh found in indian and reproduced .
so % uh many people-
see , not only the regular tiger but the white tiger , okay .
so % uh let me try to get you to the price of the night safari .
% uh sorry the price of the zoo % uh although we do have % uh package ticket where you see the
several parks and you get some discount .
so , here we go .
i told you that it 's run by wildlife saf~
% uh reserves .
so we have % uh special pricing with discount built in .
if you visit two attractions % uh you get a discount .
see , if you visit the zoo alone , that is twenty dollars .
do you see there ?
% uh if you add-in the night safari it 's forty two .
and if you combine it with the bird park , it is thirty two .
so it 's only up to you , you know , % um how much time you have and % uh what you want to see .
so i guess for the two days i 'll be staying in singapore , i can-
i 'll be able to enjoy my stay % um visiting the zoo and the botanic gardens .
so i think % uh that 's fine for me .
i-
yes , zoo botanic gardens % uh you can even do the night safari , it 's next to the zoo .
now , you can do a lot and you have a lot more money left % uh to do shopping .
yes , correct .
so that 's it ?
% uh yes , that 's right .
yah .
% oh good % uh i hope i have been of help to you .
yes .
thank you very much .
you 're very welcome jen and look forward to seeing you and your friend .
alright .
see you soon .
alright , bye .
bye .
see you , bye .
bye .
bye .
bye .
yes , goodbye , can you hear me ?
yes .
yes , okay .
alright .
okay .
hello , good afternoon .
hi , good afternoon .
i 'm % uh participant number % uh forty .
four zero ?
yes ma'am .
and your name , sir ?
% uh my name is marlowe
that 's m a r l o w e .
m a r l o w e , with an extra e ?
l o-
yup , that 's right .
okay , i thought it 's like marlon brando .
wow .
yup , that 's right .
my name is jeanne , j e a n n e
and i 'm tour guide number two .
how may i help you marlowe ?
alright .
% um well i 'm planning to visit the % um % uh singapore by around % uh-
during the race % uh weekend % uh for formula one .
% um i 'm thinking what are the places that i can % uh go to if-
% uh during that time ?
for~
% uh that 's the september period .
% uh you will be at the formula one to watch the races
so i think it 's better if i get you % uh attractions that are near the formula one venue .
% ah but % uh do you want to settle where you want to live first , where you want to stay ?
% uh % hm , that would be great .
yah , that would be best
% um 'cause i wan na % um be ne~
just near or like % uh in a hotel or % um a place
which is just a walking distance from the race track .
okay , yes .
that 's very wise because if you take public transports % um some of the roads are closed off
because it is % uh , what you call it ?
the approach roads to the venue .
that 's a-
yup .
it 's a street race i believe
so some of the r~
% uh local roads are % uh usual-
% uh they 're gon na close it but % um
that are usually open .
okay , there is a beach road hotel
and beach road is just adjacent to the race track
and it 's very near .
and it 's
you know , the public transport will also not be % uh passing by
because i think they will not be allowed there
because the road leads % uh into the race track area .
yah .
yah .
yah .
i see .
% um jeanne , i do n't want really any % uh fancy stuff for the hotel
so just basic % um where i could just rest
% uh because i also want to % uh go around the city % um just before the races .
% oh yes , of course .
this hotel is not the high priced one .
there are high priced ones where % uh right on the race track .
% uh those prices % uh are much higher during the period of the race
because that 's , you know % um-
yah , make sense .
yah and the people who are really keen on % uh the race
some of them they do n't mind spending hundreds of dollars on it .
but
here we have-
% uh okay .
can you see on the screen ?
i see , yah .
yup .
% um i think the first or the second one
% uh the beach hotel or the park view hotel would be great .
yes .
yah .
yes , that 's % uh it 's very sensible
because it is % uh-
you know in the same location as parkroyal and of course raffles hotel
is eight hundred dollars that 's a five-star .
yah
okay .
yah , that's-
yah , that would be out of my reach .
reach , yes .
yah .
do you have the dates
or do you want us to find the dates for you the formula one race ?
% um basically the same weekend % uh during the race .
i think that 's % uh the second or third week of % uh september , right ?
yes .
usually it 's % uh last weekend
i think it 's the third weekend at the end of the month .
% uh it is the twenty first , twenty second and twenty third .
% um okay .
yup , that would be perfect .
for this year , okay .
% um okay .
how much do i save if in case we book a little bit earlier just like re~
maybe right now if we can book them so that we can % uh maybe save something % um
% uh as compared to % uh booking them right before the race weekend ?
% uh booking them the right on the race weekend i think it 's near impossible
it will be fully booked already .
yah , i know .
yah .
so % uh if you book now here it says a hundred and thirty dollars book this .
% uh when are you-
i mean how are you travelling ?
are you with a friend or are you coming alone ?
% uh i 'll just be alone % uh for the travel .
okay .
so it 's just one single room huh ?
yup .
% uh it 's actually the same price if you see here .
because they are not supplying a breakfast .
yup .
so let see if % uh they are available and whether the hundred and thirty dollars still holds .
okay .
september -
you want to come in on the twenty first ?
% um i think twentieth s~
% um that would % uh would be okay or the twenty first .
% um i 'll check my % uh tickets .
i think that 's gon na be on the twenty first early % uh part of the day
like % um around eight o'clock in the morning .
% uh yes , that 's ideal .
yes .
yah .
yah .
you could even walk around , you know and have a look at the place .
and so you can in fact leave on the twenty fourth morning .
i think at-
yah , right .
yup .
alright that 's correct .
because that would be after the race .
okay , 2012 .
and you only want one room , right ?
right .
okay .
so let 's have a look .
% um , okay .
we have to wait for the response and see if they have rooms or % uh what sort of price .
they have put there normally that 's % uh you know
it 's a hundred and thirty dollars if you book now .
so % uh-
i see .
that would be perfect .
% um and there are a lot of % uh places where % uh we can % uh get something to eat % um
like almost % uh twenty four hours % uh a day , right ?
yes .
in singapore we are very greedy nation ,
we are eating all the time .
wow .
yah .
% uh i really like to % um try again some of those % um food from the street hawkers
like % um those pork roast and stuff .
% uh okay .
there 's a market that is % uh very near you within walking distance
and if i walk the same distance
because when i go by bus my bus stop somewhere near there .
and % uh there you can get % uh local food .
% uh i 'm not sure if i can get you-
% uh whether they have % uh a website
because this-
it 's what we used to call a hawker centre but we do n't have hawker centre
% uh so it 's called a food centre
and it 's called the beach road .
wow , perfect .
% ah , yah .
perfect .
% um % hm , yah .
okay .
that would be fine .
% er i-
as long as there are % um something to eat % uh somewhere near that would be fine for me .
yes .
% uh around the hotel also % uh there are places that you can come out and eat
and if you want something in an air-conditioned place
there 's also a food centre % uh nearby at raffles city
which is a big convention and exhibition centre .
but you know many people work there and % uh
they ca n't afford to be , you know going out to markets to look for food .
so at these food centres you 'll get decent food , local food
and at affordable prices .
% uh huh .
% oh i see .
i see .
alright , cool .
% um so yah % um we 'll book the % uh hotel reservation % um
where % um we~
there we can kind of settle to un~
% uh the place where i can get something to eat .
% um you know some places where i can get some , you know those race souvenirs
for % uh a cheaper price ?
yah .
% uh i do n't know about cheaper price but % uh i know that during the race % uh
% uh they do have vendors % uh offer their souvenirs .
% um , yah .
% hm , okay .
% uh because in singapore we protects % uh copyright
so i 'm not sure that you can get % uh sort of like imitation of the real stuff .
you wo n't be able to get it
i do n't think so .
% uh the market i 'm talking about it does n't have % uh a website
but i can describe to you what they have there .
% uh okay .
yah .
that 's fine .
yah that will be perfect
so that i can % uh easily locate it .
yes .
% uh let me see beach road .
% um % hm , let me see .
yah .
oops , sorry .
that 's okay .
so those % uh on the map , the ones that have markings % uh that look like buses
those are the bus stops , right ?
% uh i ca n't see .
the small blue ones .
no , i think they are attractions .
they are places-
i do n't see the key here .
does it say ?
no it 's urban development authority so it 's not a bus stop , okay ?
% uh , okay .
okay .
i see .
but your market is just down the way .
your hotel is where this little % uh like % uh exclamation mark is .
okay .
yup .
% uh huh .
so you walk down here
and % uh at sultan gate palace we have the oldest mosque in singapore you can visit .
and if you want non-souvenir % uh non~
sorry , non-race souvenirs you can do shopping along arab street .
this whole area is a conservation area .
and just beyond sultan gate is the market that i 'm talking about .
okay .
% oh perfect .
okay .
do you know % um satay or kebab ?
are you familiar with kebab ?
yah .
% um not that really familiar with that % uh place but , yah .
% um what 's that all about ?
it's-
a kebab is meat that is skewered and-
% oh , okay .
alright .
so our version of it here in % uh southeast asia is satay ,
we called it s a t a y .
% oh , okay .
and here you can see the vendors-
they have different kinds of meats .
% uh these are at beach road you get the % uh malay version of it with peanut sauce .
and so you would n't be getting any pork satay
you would be getting % uh chicken , beef and % uh mutton .
wow , okay .
are those % uh spicy
'cause i kinda like spicy stuff ?
okay .
if you like spicy
% uh there are other spicy dishes i can introduce you .
these are more sweet ,
they are usually marinated to be sweet .
and the sauce is peanut sauce gravy ,
you see the little bowl that is there ?
% oh , okay .
yup , % uh % hm .
yah .
and you eat it with rice
that has been cooked and-
traditionally they used leaves to weave a little basket to cook it .
but sometimes they put it in a tube
and then it comes out sort of circular form and it sliced up .
now you also get % uh-
sorry you were gon na say ?
% oh , okay .
i see .
no , nothing .
i-
% um i like what i 'm seeing .
yah .
okay on the last picture here on the-
at the top
can you see slices of cucumber ?
% uh % hm , yup .
and % uh fresh onions .
so if-
since you are travelling alone you are not gon na offend anybody ,
that 's not very sweet , okay .
so-
i see , yah .
yah .
right .
% uh so this is one of the favourite dishes
% uh and you can eat there .
yah .
yah .
perfect .
perfect , i like this .
yup .
% um and then % um would you also be able to hook me up with some tickets for the % uh flyer
'cause i think based on what i read % um specially during the race day
it 's a wonderful spot where you can see the whole track , right ?
okay .
yes .
% uh because the flyer is located % uh within view of the race track
and % uh the flyer is % uh very slow moving .
so you get % uh time to soak in the view
not only the race track but the surrounding area .
if i am % uh not mistaken it is only twenty nine dollars .
wow , okay .
yes .
i 'll show you the location of it .
okay , cool .
so can you see it here ?
yup .
and the race track is just nearby .
and % uh it 's also near % uh the place where we book the-
my stay , right ?
yes .
okay , perfect .
% uh if you % uh do n't mind walking you can walk there , you know .
it 's nice to walk because % uh it 's by the river
and it's-
lots of things to see and % uh enjoy while you 're % uh doing your walk .
uh-
% uh yah .
yah .
i do n't really mind walking
that's-
that would be perfect .
i 'm a walking sort of tourist , okay .
gon na show you the flyer now .
yah .
% oh , okay .
okay .
so you 're seeing just a little bit of it at the corner there .
% uh this advertisement they are trying to encourage you
to % uh take in a tour
but here-
there you can see .
yup .
% oh , wow .
okay .
you can-
the butler
of course this one is % uh not so cheap huh .
fifteen dollars if you can prove you 're a student
but % uh i do n't think you 're a student , right ?
are you ? % uh-
no .
not anymore .
% uh not anymore .
so marlowe i 'm afraid you have to pay % uh twenty nine dollars % uh .
% oh yah .
% oh , okay .
i think that would be worth it , yah .
you have-
% uh singapore sling is a cocktail that was concocted at the raffles hotel .
it 's got gin , angostura bitters and-
you know if you pay extra you can enjoy your meal or you can have % uh a drink .
% hm , okay .
% uh i 'd like to taste the sling .
yah , so i think-
yah so you just be prepared to pay a little bit more .
there are places where you can eat there .
% uh % hm , okay .
% uh this is-
wait a minute .
wait .
% uh so this is the cocktail flight .
okay .
you are given the cocktail
but it is not the singapore sling it 's their own .
i think they have created something else green in colour .
because the % uh singapore sling is pinkish red in colour .
i see .
yah .
so you 're looking at the capsule now .
% uh so this is % uh how it looks like inside huh ?
yes , that 's right .
so there are restaurants around the area .
there is % uh place where you can buy things .
so-
okay .
% hm , okay .
yah .
so dining on the flyer
i think this is chilli crab ,
let me try and get it for you .
because you say you like something hot , right ?
okay .
yah .
% uh , one of our iconic dishes here that many people like to eat
is chilli crab .
% oh cool .
i want to try that .
yah you enjoy crabs , right ?
you do n't have any allergy or anything ?
yup .
nope .
% uh it is crabs cooked with chilli and % uh
what do you call it ?
% um tomato sauce .
and if you do n't mind eating with your fingers
i always recommend that it 's finger licking good .
wow .
okay , i really do n't mind .
% um , yah .
so seafood paradise .
there .
that 's where you can % uh have it .
oh we are getting % uh sound .
no .
it 's a restaurant .
we 'll try and cancel this .
yah , that's-
yah , no problem .
alright , okay .
yah .
okay .
we have got % uh-
this level one is about the area where the flyer is .
% uh % hm , okay .
do you want to see anything else ?
yah % um , somewhere near % um or
% uh somewhere i can get some drinks maybe
% um just to cap the night off after .
% oh then i recommend the raffles hotel
because that is a very historic hotel .
% uh that is a national monument
and-
% uh okay .
% oh , really ?
so-
usually it 's the british who know about this hotel
because they were our colonial rulers before independence .
but this hotel here people often go in and take photographs .
% uh and we have there a place called the long bar .
% oh , okay .
where the reception of the hotel is now ,
% uh it 's all been changed but the long bar used to be right at the front of the hotel
and it was the longest bar in the whole world at one time .
wow , okay .
okay .
but-
and what do they-
% uh do they have lots of mixes there ?
yes .
they have lots of mixes but the people who go there
% uh they go for the singapore sling
% hm , okay .
because the sling was created there at the hotel
i see .
so-
by their bartender .
so that 's % uh where i can get that % uh famous sling , huh ?
yes , that 's right .
so you 're getting it % uh from the place itself
it 's very special .
you can even buy the glass to bring home .
% uh % hm , yah .
i would like-
really ?
wow .
yes .
and they-
they wo n't sort of clean up your glass and give it to you
they give you a new one % uh nicely packaged .
okay , cool .
cool , that would be perfect .
and then % um so that would be % um the itinerary for at least a day .
% um any other places i can visit that would % uh be very interesting
like % um % un a-
i believe you have a great big zoo
% um somewhere
% um the other side i think ? % uh-
yes we have a zoo
it is out of town
but because of where you 're staying near the % uh subway station
you can take the subway and then you can connect .
i see .
% um i heard that % uh for me to be able to % uh use the public transport
i have to have like % uh those cards
% um instead of paying % uh cash or coins .
% uh yes , that would be very easy .
but just let me show you the zoo first
because it 's coming out from the screen .
okay .
okay , cool .
go .
it 's in the north of singapore
and where the race is held is in the south of singapore .
but you can connect % uh to the nearest big town
and there you take a bus that will bring you directly to the zoo
where the few stops along % uh housing areas .
so it 's also a good opportunity for you to see the type of housing singaporeans live in ,
the scenery of , you know the natural neighbourhoods that you see .
you will not be in the business area when you take this bus
that connects you % uh from the % uh train station to the bu~
% uh zoo .
% oh , okay .
cool .
'cause the zoo is where not many people live
it is in % uh a reserve that is % uh
to help us to collect rain water .
it 's next to a reservoir and that 's why it is so attractive .
i see .
alright .
yah , this would be perfect .
% um i saw something there like a night safari
is that % um-
yes there is also a night safari
% uh but you will be watching your show , right ?
yah .
% uh yah .
so it 's either the night safari or you 're gon na see your race .
% oh yah .
so i think % ah i 'll watch the race first .
% oh yah .
watch the race and either you extend the date
or you come back another time for it .
yah .
no .
yah , i think that would-
% um i think i 'll just visit the zoo for the day , yah
and then watch the races by the night .
yes , that 's a good idea .
let me just show you % uh some of the attractions .
sure .
so what we do is we plan it so that it 's not only the animal on show
you get a little bit of the natural environment .
this is part of % uh the australian outback ,
so we 've got wallabies there .
we 'll go through quickly so i can tell you about the % uh the card that you asked me about .
cat country .
do n't they look loveable ?
yah i like this .
i like it .
and i think these are mousedeers , huh .
they are-
% oh , okay .
have you seen them before ?
no , not really .
i have n't seen them yet
but that would be great if i can see them up close .
yah , they are very cute
they are the size of % uh little rats
but they are actually look like deer .
wow .
% oh , okay .
so it 's called a mousedeer .
% hm , that 's why .
i see .
and-
the enclosure is just at the entrance so it 's very near for you to see .
% oh , okay .
then we have elephants .
okay .
are these the ones that would spray water to you if ever you pass by or so ?
% uh i thought you knew it more than % uh i thought you did .
it's-
i should n't tell you because % uh actually it 's during the show .
% uh so if you sits at a certain place
you might get a little bit of a shower , that 's all .
they do n't spray at you all the time
not to worry .
% uh okay .
i see .
okay , cool .
alright .
they are-
they do-
% uh the show is not doing tricks . it 's just-
% uh the show is not doing tricks . it 's just-
naturally they heave heavy logs in some countries
so they are like work elephants .
so here their mahouts which is the name of their trainer
help them-
teach them you know how to continue doing this so that people will understand .
i see , okay .
and here-
% oh so that 's mahouts , okay .
mahouts is the name of the handler .
that's-
i see , okay .
yah , that 's the term .
these are % um lemurs that you naturally have to go to madagascar to see .
and the industries called fragile forest
which is % uh a forest area that 's encased in netting .
so we also have some free flight birds there and butterflies .
it 's a very lovely setting for photography .
% oh , wow .
wow , i 'd like that .
i 'd like that .
% uh i think i 'll bring % um my camera with a large memory
for this one , for this trip .
yes , a very large memory .
so you know because animals move around
and so if you % uh want you can click as many as you like with them doing different things .
yah .
yah .
yah , okay .
% yah , okay .
yah .
that i 'd like that
i 'd like to see that .
here we have some baboons ,
they are hamadryas baboons .
so the environment is not forest it 's like hilly .
they have multiplied a lot and do n't be afraid if they come at you .
there 's a place that 's % uh covered and with glass .
so if you do n't want to see them in the open where you 're protected by a mode ,
you go to the glass covered area .
and if the male baboon thinks you look like % uh somebody who will court his wife
he will come charging at you .
% oh , okay .
% oh , really ?
yah , it 's quite exciting
because % uh you know it 's so near but you are protected by the glass
so it 's fun .
that 's nice .
okay , i like that .
and i do n't want to mess with this-
% uh these baboons .
% uh sometimes-
no , i would n't recommend that you do , yah .
yah .
yah .
% uh so the zoo is precautious
it will not % uh take any risk with anybody .
okay .
orang-utans in the wild if you see them also
do n't go near them because they have very-
they are very strong .
but once in the zoo
some of them have been bred here
they are singapore citizens .
% hm , really ?
so-
% uh at the breakfast show you can take photographs with them .
and they 're in a % uh open area
so they are swinging from tree to tree very near you .
alright .
wow , okay .
that would be perfect .
you can also take photos with them .
% ah , okay .
cool .
you will just pay a small fee .
so have you seen polar bears before ?
not yet , i would like that .
so you do n't have to go to a cold place
and you can see the polar bear and % uh still be in the equatorial area .
% oh yah .
yah , i 'd like to see that .
% uh there 's a show in the morning and you can see him catching fish
and al-
so hitting a ball high up
so they have been trained .
of course they have an air-conditioned area where they can sleep if they like .
this would be nice .
wow .
% oh , okay .
yah , i 'd like this-
i 'd like to see this , yah .
this is one of the handsome occupants of primate kingdom .
wow .
i like this picture .
i hope i can take some % uh picture like this .
sure .
% uh you will be able to because in the primate kingdom again it 's open
but % uh the animals are in separate islands so that the species do not mix .
and they have % uh water mode
is that little islands within an area
and they have trees where they can climb up and down .
so over the years they have decided that well this is my house
and i 'm happy i wo n't leave it
because they have % uh free lodging , free medical facilities .
% uh the only thing is they do n't know how to smile at you .
well that 's fine
as long as % uh i can get % uh decent pictures of them this would be fine .
yes .
the only thing is do n't be enthusiastic and jump over if you are a long jumper .
% uh you should n't be able to get through % uh
because if you enter any of these % uh areas then the animals are likely to be defensive
because you are encroaching on their home .
i wo n't .
i wo n't do n't worry .
i just want to take pictures .
% uh okay .
yah .
so if you go you must take picture of this one
it 's a proboscis monkey .
how different is this one % uh from the other monkeys that we saw a while ago ?
this one is in a different environment
because it comes from the forest of borneo
it 's very shy .
i saw it for thirty seconds in its natural environment when i went over to borneo .
so they gave us some and they have bred successfully .
and the thing is % um you see this % uh nose hanging down ?
wow .
for the male the nose grows long , it hangs down
and for some reason the females think the longer the nose the handsomer he is .
% oh , okay .
okay , so that 's how they classify who 's handsome who 's not .
% uh yes , that 's right .
and the proboscis there fore refers to the length of the nose .
% hm , i see .
alright , cool .
if they are breeding at the time
you may see a female with % uh baby
and that 's really thrilling .
nice .
i hope they are not shy when i visit .
% uh no , they are not shy yah .
lots of tourists have taken photographs of them .
i think they get used to the environment .
you 're not going to kidzworld so i will skip that .
i see .
% uh % hm , okay .
% uh do you like snakes ?
% uh are you-
% uh i do n't want to touch them though
i just want to see them .
okay , you just want to see them .
we have a reptile garden .
% uh yah , it 's within the area where we have crocodiles , % uh % uh monitor lizards and % uh komodo dragons .
if i 'm not mistaken this is a komodo dragon
% uh normally found in some islands in indonesia .
but there is also an area where you can see snakes .
% uh it-
it is fully enclosed so you choose whether you want to go in .
so if you enter through the gate
you 'll find snakes coiled around tree trunks and you can take photographs .
yah .
% oh yah .
% oh okay .
okay .
but they do n't just drop right in front of you or right at you ?
no they specially select these % uh snakes
so the species is specially selected .
so you you walk on a wooden walkway and-
% uh so it 's quite fun .
suddenly you make a turn and there you have a snake right on-
you know , nearby .
% uh and then you just walk out-
% uh you enter by one gate and you enter-
you exit by another .
okay .
i see .
okay , pretty safe .
safe , very safe .
% uh if i can go through it anybody else can .
% uh yah .
okay .
alright .
okay .
% uh so this is african region with lions .
% oh , nice .
i like this .
yah .
so even if you % um do n't walk
you can see the lions if you just take a tram right around .
the lions-
we have quite a few i forget how many
but some of them maybe in a place that 's % uh good for photos , yah .
if not you can walk in the same area after you get off the tram
and then you can % uh walk and position yourself .
and you must not leave the zoo without seeing this .
% oh , nice .
i like this .
this is not the regular tiger ,
this is-
% uh special species is the white tiger .
wow .
and it was found years ago in india .
% oh , that 's pretty weird
because i understand there are-
the yellow ones are more often in india .
yes .
% uh and one day they found one that was white
% uh he had gene mutation
and % uh maharaja or the ruler he started breeding them .
and then when the offspring came out , you know maybe half white half yellow ,
they-
it-
they continue to breed until they got the white gene being % uh predominant .
i see .
nice , a alright .
so we have three of them .
% oh okay .
nice .
they are in an area where they have a deep pool .
so sometimes you can see them swimming .
% oh , wow .
okay .
besides the orang-utans these are very popular with % uh tourists .
yah so your camera-
you do n't forget your camera
you 'll be enjoying .
% uh % hm , okay .
i wo n't .
yah , that 's right .
so % uh the zoo is really % uh a must-see place i feel for people .
yah .
yah , okay .
i 'll % uh really want to % uh go there .
any other % um attractions % uh that i could go to % um not that far away from % uh the race place ?
okay .
this zoo you have to take a train
it 's a little bit further away , okay ?
so i 'm going to find you other attractions .
% uh what are-
what would you consider visiting ,
a museum or an outdoor area ?
% um , i heard you have % uh universal studios ?
universal studios , yes okay
we can try and get universal studios % uh and get you some pictures .
this is on sentosa island
it 's % uh not so near that you can walk .
you 'll have to take % uh bus and also % uh take a shuttle of the outside of universal studios
go into sentosa island .
yah .
% oh , okay .
% hm , okay .
yah , i 'd like visit % uh that place .
so you take a bus % uh from near your hotel
and i think if you ask the hotel concierge they 'll be able to tell you where the-
in fact i can tell you .
you-
if you walk to the raffles hotel if you had your sling ,
around the corner of raffles hotel % uh facing raffles city which is the convention centre ,
% uh there 's a bus number one three one
and it will take you to a place called harbourfront .
can you see on the map here ?
okay .
yup , % uh % hm .
so harbourfront here .
you get off the % uh bu~
the-
sorry , the train -
the bus stop in fact .
and in fact if you wait there , there are shuttle buses free of charge
that will bring you into universal studios .
okay .
% um okay .
perfect , nice .
i like that .
you do n't have to take the sentosa bus that will cost you an extra dollar
because here % uh universal studios is very happy to have you % uh visit them , okay .
okay .
alright .
i saw something like % uh the transformers % uh ride
is that % uh in the % uh universal studios ?
yes % uh but i 'm not going to show % uh all the rides .
you can just see here ?
just a picture , this is easier to see .
okay
yah .
yup .
it 's % uh-
you know if you like thrills and scares .
yah , i like that .
okay .
% uh lots of places to amuse you .
% uh this is the transformer , the ride
you know you will be % uh having the thrill of your life
% uh as you are you know % uh moving around .
let me just go through % uh what they have here .
so if rides you 're interested in % uh-
yah .
sure .
yup .
i am very interested with the rides .
they have the battlestar galactica % uh cylon .
so it 's a suspended roller coaster
goes up around and upside down .
wow .
i like that .
i like that .
you like that ?
okay , here 's more .
% uh intense corkscrews and cobra roll .
wow .
okay , i like that .
i 'd love to ride that-
% uh ride after this transformers .
% uh okay .
% uh that 's really fun % huh .
i 'd go to ride after .
yah .
we also have % uh battlestar galactica
choose your side human versus cylon .
and you have the-
you engage in the ultimate intergalactic battle between good and evil
at world 's tallest duelling roller coasters themed after hit tv show battlestar galactica .
i see , okay .
i like that .
and then % um what else ?
so there are the rides , yah .
% uh so % uh-
it 's also ancient egypt , mummies and obelisk .
so you are transported back % uh eighty years to the nineteen thirties
to the golden age of egyptian exploration .
% oh okay .
% hm , okay .
% uh here % uh you can face the wrath of the mummy
on the world 's first psychological thrill ride .
total darkness .
% uh on all sides you get huge fire balls , swarms of scarab beetles and an army of warrior mummies .
so % uh-
yikes !
okay .
okay , i like that .
so it 's adventure all the way for you , you know .
% yah i know .
yah i really like that .
yah .
okay .
that 's nice .
% uh that-
yes .
% uh i can see % uh how you will be very excited
because i 've also been to the disneyland and % um % uh to the universal studios ,
yah and really % uh engaging .
yah .
okay .
okay , i think i 'm gon na % um book % uh some tickets for % uh this trip for % uh-
in universal studios or at-
% um gon na get some of those and then we 'll % um-
let 's hook up the tickets for the zoo % um a little bit later on .
and then % um anywhere else where i can % uh get % uh lots of % uh nice adventure ?
% uh i think you 'll get the most adventure here already
% uh at universal studios .
okay . % oh okay .
okay . % oh okay .
alright .
% um let me see .
% um any place where i can maybe get some exercise
% um maybe play some football ?
% hm , playing football you have to hook up with % uh the local teams
i do n't information on that
because football is played % uh-
it 's a team game , right ?
% oh , okay .
yah .
so % uh off-hand now i would not be able to tell you
but % uh if you asked your travel agents % uh and-
to source for you or % uh we have more time to look into the internet
and we contact % uh a clubs or schools that are willing to entertain you then you will be able to .
but % uh you will not have time i think , you know
because % uh-
i know .
yah .
and since % uh kind of short of a trip .
% um i think where else should-
i go ?
% um yah , shopping % um % uh shirts , any other % um-
'cause i wan na bring some souvenirs back home .
% um any-
not really race related for % um-
maybe for the family , i think .
for the family % uh do you want to shop at % uh this resort , the resorts world singapore ?
or do you want , you know % uh simpler % uh souvenirs
say from chinatown or from % uh the shopping centres ?
% uh i think that would be % um-
% um would that % uh mean like % uh those bags and shirts ?
yes .
bags and shirt you can get in chinatown % uh easily .
% uh yah , i think that would be perfect .
yah .
yes .
you can go down to chinatown and % uh % uh you 'll be able to get bags and shirts very easily .
% uh along the street side .
% uh and prices are also affordable
so you can buy more , you know more variety .
% um okay .
i see .
so how do i get there from % uh maybe from the hotel or from-
maybe from raffles centre ?
% uh you can take the train from city hall station .
% uh % hm , okay .
okay , do you see the red line ?
yup , okay .
so beach road is just % uh nearby okay .
and-
so if you-
at city hall you can take-
let me see what 's the easiest connection , well either way .
you can go to dhoby ghaut .
% um okay .
okay .
this is a major intersection with three lines meeting .
and then you take the purple line which is the northeast line
and it 's just two stops down to chinatown .
% oh , okay .
okay .
gotcha .
okay .
okay .
so that 's where you can get a variety of % uh things to buy .
alright .
can i-
i 'll try and see if i can get you some photos % uh some photos
so you 'll have a better idea .
is that also where i can get some gadgets % um
% uh like phones or % uh tablets ?
% uh phones or tablets -
phones you probably can buy-
i ca n't tell you exactly the shops but i think i 've seen phone shops there .
but if you 're talking about information technology
% uh there is a centre in singapore where you have % uh a lots of these shops
so it would be easier for you to pick and choose down there
and it is called funan centre .
% oh okay .
yes .
it 's also very near to % uh your hotel .
okay .
so let me show you funan centre .
people get it products , peripherals .
yah that would be perfect .
i like that . that 's where % uh singaporeans go .
i like that . that 's where % uh singaporeans go .
% uh so here you are at city hall .
you can in fact walk .
you sound like a strong young man , right ?
yah .
% uh i 'd like to walk .
so-
yes .
so if you walk down % uh to-
% uh let me see if i can get the map here .
% oh , okay .
okay this is a picture of the store .
% uh we have buses and we have % uh-
i think if you do n't want to walk you can take a bus .
yah .
okay .
alright , there .
yes .
okay .
so the funan place where you can do your shopping is here
and your hotel is , okay to the right there .
can you see % uh beach centre -
yah .
% oh , that 's near .
yes , that 's near .
that 's why i say it 's in fact walkable
% uh because then you can take in the sights along the way .
% uh you can see % uh the saint andrew 's cathedral
which is % uh historic monuments .
and % uh nearby % uh if you divert a little bit
it 's the first church built in singapore that 's still is % uh more or less in its original form with add-ons
it 's called the armenian church .
alright , yah .
% oh , okay .
so as you walk you get to see more % uh % uh than you would
if you % uh hop up a bus .
it 's not very far
i mean i could walk the distance , yah .
alright .
yah , i 'd % uh-
i think % uh i 'd like to walk from the hotel to that place .
so in the day before the race you have lots of things to occupy you , yah .
yah .
yah , i know .
% um hm .
so there .
that 's one spot i could go to and then maybe chinatown and then-
yah those places where % uh i could go .
well % um where else i-
i 'm thinking of % uh some other places i would like to go to .
% um do you-
what are the other attractions that you would recommend ?
% uh i think if you are in this area and you 're willing to walk
you will be able to see attractions as you 're walking .
% uh so if you walk a little bit further down here
you see the singapore river ?
% uh % hm , okay .
so the race track is here , okay
% uh around here .
this is the singapore river .
% uh there are bars and restaurants here
it 's very scenic .
and if you were to % uh move down a little bit more-
if you turn this way towards the marina bay
it 's the merlion park .
% um , okay .
okay , % uh i do n't know if you heard of the merlion .
it-
% um i think i 've heard of that
but % um can you remind me again ? i 'm sorry .
but % um can you remind me again ? i 'm sorry .
% uh it 's the first emblem of the singapore tourism board when it was started .
half lion and half % uh fish
because we 're an island .
% oh , okay .
now i remember .
okay , yah .
% uh and one of the early princes when he landed on singapore island
singa is lion .
% uh but
we have no lions in singapore .
we have no record of lions naturally born in singapore
so perhaps he saw a tiger which used to roam in our forest
or a big deer , yah .
% ah , okay .
yup .
% um , i see .
so this is a place many tourist like to go
% uh to take photographs as % uh you can see some of the tourist there .
% uh otherwise if you-
then if you-
after you have taken your photographs you can head back along the river
and % uh go down towards funan .
and from funan you carry on walking
you will be in chinatown area .
yah .
% uh % hm , okay .
yah .
i think i 'll need to pack my sneakers .
% oh yes , the best pair of sneakers that you have % uh so-
you know you are comfortable .
so it would n't hurt .
yup .
yes .
or you can take a break every now and then along the way .
stop at a coffee shop and
you can have a drink that many of us enjoy .
% uh we-
do you drink coffee or tea ?
% oh , okay .
% um coffee , tea , both .
% um i 'd like it cold though .
yes cold .
so % uh we too like it cold .
you can have it with % uh evaporated milk
and % uh you can add ice to it
so it 's called % uh kopi-si .
can you remember that ?
yah , i 'll % uh take note of that .
and-
or you can just tell him with ice % uh yah .
okay .
yah , they will understand .
si means you 're adding evaporated milk so it makes it really yummy .
okay .
% um , i see .
cool .
and % uh that goes best with % uh-
is it % uh coffee bun ?
yes you can have % uh bread and toast with it if you like .
% uh you can have a kind of jam
made of coconut milk and % uh sugar and pandanus leaves .
are you familiar with pandanus leaves ?
yah , % uh-
yah .
so it 's a fragrant jam that we put inside
it 's called kaya toast .
kaya is the name of the jam .
and if you like it you can buy it home as a souvenir also .
% yah , i like that .
you just have to pack it carefully .
% oh , okay .
i hope it does n't stink inside the plane .
% oh no .
it does n't stink in fact it 's very fragrant
because of the pandanus .
i see .
yah .
so you can get it in jars like this , yah .
yah .
okay , % uh % hm .
so we have the description there .
and ya kun here is a very old % uh shop with a long history
and now they have opened little cafés all over singapore .
it 's very affordable .
and they have cheese toast
they have toast with % uh butter and sugar , with kaya .
and if you want some more nutrition you can have soft boiled eggs .
% uh they do it perfectly .
yes .
in fact i just had it this morning .
wow .
eighty cents for one egg .
okay .
because i did n't want to eat too many .
yah .
yah .
that would be perfect .
yes .
so % uh you-
this is something % uh local that you can try .
here are some pictures of it .
% uh it's-
% uh yah .
yah .
wow .
looks yummy .
alright .
if it is very hot you can settle for ice cream toast .
i think that 's a modern add-on .
% oh okay .
% uh the traditional is the kaya toast
the one in the first picture top left .
okay .
okay .
so if your sneakers are getting tired
you can give your sneakers % uh a rest .
i see .
i think-
is that the soft boiled eggs ?
yes , that 's right .
and it 's perfectly done , really perfectly done .
i can not get it done this way .
you know sometimes you get it with these transparent parts that are supposed to be white
but here % uh they are all white .
i think it 's the temperature was there ,
water and the fact that the eggs are very fresh .
right , per~
i see .
they do n't tell you the secret though no , do n't they ?
% uh no because-
if you look at the side bar here on the left
can you see franchise opportunities ?
no .
you have to pay them a lot of money to learn the secret .
yikes , okay .
if you like pork -
do you like pork ?
yah , i do .
% uh as you 're walking in that area there is also % uh pork .
% uh % uh what we like to eat is % uh pork bones in soup that you can % uh try
and it 's also a coffee shop
just down from the river near to where your stall is .
i think that would be nice .
yah .
yah , i like that .
and it 's got a lot of garlic inside
so the garlic is also yummy .
yah , yummy .
i like that .
that 's a good thing about travelling alone
you do n't have to worry about you know smelling stinky
or your girlfriend or your companion is going to scold you .
yah .
% hm , i know .
yah , wow .
okay .
i like that .
yes .
so this is the chinese version further down
% uh they 're showing you some of the ingredients .
i see .
% um these are the-
% um there 's a spicy option on this one , right ?
% uh no , this is not spicy this is garlic % uh alright .
% um , okay .
% oh but
normally people put lots of pepper in it .
% oh , okay .
i-
that would be fine with me .
that there-
yes .
so it 's a spicy-
so they-
normally a lot of restaurants now leave the spicy options to you
so that it 's optional .
% uh it 's optional so that you can % uh put it or you can not put it in .
yes ?
% um okay , got it .
okay .
yah .
alright , i like this .
% uh any other things you 'd like to know
besides the shopping , chinatown and % uh and the food to eat .
% uh what else ?
% um i think % um-
yah i think that would be all .
% uh i would-
% uh i think i have all the things that i would need , alright .
so i 'll % um-
get in touch again maybe % uh with the bookings
so that we can finalise everything ?
yes , indeed .
remember to book early
because that is a very popular period .
okay .

the sound , the feeling of water if there 's a water coming out from-
you will get some-
you 'll get some sprinkle of water on your face-
si~
% oh really ?
yes .

i 'm planning to visit singapore for a holiday this coming september twentieth .

% oh , right .

well every month is a good month .
september is having % uh a very nice event here in singapore .
at that particular month we have the formula one speed car racing .
okay .
and how about the-
do you like cars ?
not really i 'm not into that so much .
% oh you 're not into that okay , alright .
so you 're not fond of car racing , cars .
then good for you
because otherwise the ticket will be very-
a little bit more costly .
yes .
% oh i see .
i 'll be travelling-
i 'm planning to travel with my daughter .
% oh you have a daughter with you then .
yes .
so how old is she ?
she 's sixteen years old .
she 's sixteen years old
okay so she 's teenagers .
and how old are you ?
me ?
yah , may i ask ?
% uh yes .
it 's okay i 'm thirty seven .
% oh you are thirty seven .
okay so you are coming with your daughter then .
s~
yes .
yes i 'm planning to visit on september .
okay .
and do you have any budget in mind or take a places yah-
or places that you may like to see in singapore ?
% oh we 're travelling in a m~
by medium budget
by one thousand do~
singapore dollars .
will that do for two days ?
% uh yes that also depends on % uh which hotels you prefer to stay
in a budget hotel or you prefer to stay a little bit much more premium hotel
then you probably have less spending then .
okay what is the name of the hotel you are recommending ?
alright .
but first thing before i go to the hotel
can i just find out a little bit more from you ?
like for example if you are here in singapore
you like to do shopping mall or you prefer to goes out to some theme park as well
like theme park like you know % um some movie theme parks
or some nature walk , visiting the garden all things like that
or you prefer something else .
so that i can you know put you-
put it in a place or hotel whereby near to that place ,
you spend less on transportation , % uh easy access to public transport
so that-
these are the things that i will have to help you to consider
% uh and put you into the right place .
so tell me then .
okay-
okay .
% um i 'm thinking of shopping for christmas ahead of time
so i 'm planning to go shopping a lot .
alright .
you plan to go shopping a lot ?
okay .
and % uh any other thing in mind in that-
other than the shopping ?
my daughter and i will like to go outdoors .
we like-
go outdoors .
theme parks or probably to nature ?
% uh any will do .
any will do ?
alright .
so if you are going for shopping then % um it has to be somewhere nearby
and if you prefer to go to theme park then
it has to be also located somewhere near % uh to the public transport as well .
so % uh do you mind % um i 'll like to show it to you one of the hotel which is quite budget
and it 's located % um-
wait huh .
okay .
wait let me see % uh .
how is the weather like there % uh on september ?
well in singapore , here our weather -
% uh the temperature wise
% um maybe from twenty six degree to thirty six degree .
it 's pretty humid here .
so when you come to singapore try to wear some loose clothing
do n't wear thick clothing it will be a lot more comfortable for you .
okay .
right .
% uh like i-
no problem .
thank you for that .
so let me just see whether i can pick up that hotel alright .
it 's actually known as hotel % um eighty one at rochor
% uh which is actually a two-star hotel
it 's a budgeted hotel .
and in-
% uh from-
you have a computer , right ?
now you-
can you see from the screen itself where i 'm putting this % uh hotels up
and-
is that the merlion i 'm seeing ?
no not the merlion .
% uh okay .
okay .
right .
now if you were to take a look at the % uh-
you 're seeing the hotel -
you 're seeing the hotel rooms right now or no ?
yes i do .
yes % uh so you can see the hotel room , right ?
now if you were to see from the screen itself the room rate wise ,
i 'm trying to get the room rates for you
so that you can probably budget your holiday here huh .
right , so for the room rate wise you can see it 's hundred and thirty five
per room per night , right ?
so that will takes off % uh two hundred and seventy dollars from you .
so out of one thousand dollars two hundred and seventy dollars goes for that .
and for shopping street % um
the hotel that you see here hotel eighty one
is located quite near to the train system as well i 'll just show you the map where the location of the hotel is , yah ?
okay .
okay .
right .
you can see % uh from here the blue % um % uh bed which is here is actually hotel eighty one rochor .
it 's actually loated near to the station , two train system station which is there .
one is the little india station which we have the ne seven .
% uh from your hotel towards these % uh station is not very far away
probably around about ten minutes of walking
you should be able to reach that station ne seven
which stand for north east bound train station number seven .
and the other one which is ew twelve
that means that is a east west bound train station number twelve ,
it 's actually bugis station .
so if you are staying in this hotel -
% uh if you are putting up in this hotel
% uh both of the access towards the public transport is quite convenient
and not only that i~ you-
it 's also located % uh near to little india .
that 's where a lot of indian products are been sold there specially ladies accessories you know
and you are travelling with your daughter with you
so probably you can find something % uh nice clothing of indian style .
% uh you can % uh pick it out along this little india where the serangoon road is located .
you can see this serangoon road .
% um i guess i just blow it up a little bit for you .
okay .
now , i guess you can see it right now right , serangoon road ?
the whole street which is along serangoon road is known as little india .
many of these shops located at this area sells a lot of indian % uh products
from ladies wear to shoes , from accessories
% uh anything you name it related to the indian community you have it there .
so this is one of the nice shopping street you can find near to your hotel .
the other one walking distance towards % uh the % uh rochor canal .
you can see that there is another one which i put it the screen up here
bugis street , can you see ?
okay .
yes .
yes .
right .
% uh bugis street is also quite near to your hotel
walking distance is approximately about ten minutes away only .
and bugis junction , bugis tower and bugis village here
is one of the other shopping street that you can find % uh near to your hotel .
% uh from the bugis street itself you can find varieties of % um clothing .
if you want cheap-
a little bit-
slightly much more cheap clothing % uh maybe in reasonable price
% uh you can go to bugis village
because those % uh area they sells a lot of % um t-shirts % uh ladies accessories
% uh even for the guys if you need some watches you can pick it up from there .
there are some-
a lot of watch % uh dealers which are selling watches over there as well .
and small little gift shops are also there .
if you need to make up % uh there is also % uh hair salon located at that area .
nice shopping street in fact .
okay .
how how many minutes again by foot ?
so-
% uh it 's about ten minutes walk from your hotel .
if you see from the hotel the blue in colour ?
now you can see hotel eighty one rochor .
from there you can take a walk down and it 's not very far away , right ?
yah .
yes .
is it safe to walk to singapore ?
yes it 's quite safe % uh in singapore .
% um in fact nobody % uh should bothers you when you are walking along the street
so long as you know you do n't % um i mean-
% uh during the night time of course % uh we will suggest you not to outshine yourself
by putting a lot of jewellery .
or % uh because % um % uh this people we-
% uh in singapore here we are a very safe place
but if you try to outshine too much and you 're walking along the street
then that is not very healthy for you or safe for you , right ?
if you are wearing a decent clothing , you know walking around the street nobody will bother you .
in fact the policeman is out twenty four hours
looking at every one of us .
okay .
% oh okay .
okay .
% ah okay .
i~
i will remember that matthew .
yah , right .
so % um from here to any other shopping area is quite near .
even it 's % uh even it 's quite near to the hospital itself
you can see there 's a raffles hospital nearby .
so in case anything % uh really needs-
% uh in needs of the medical attention there is also available nearby to your hotel
so not very far away .
food wise % uh for food there 's a lot of food courts available along your
along the hotel that you are staying , along jalan besar .
and of course % uh albert street here
you can see albert street , right ?
okay .
okay .
yes .
albert street , there is also another shopping mall very nearby .
% um there is one temple which is also a heritage temple that you should not miss
in walking distance , % uh this temple here is known as the kwan im temple .
we call it goddess of mercy temple ,
very nice temple to visit .
of course if you want to ask for blessing this is also a nice temple to visit , yah .
so % uh shopping wise this is a nice area to be
and of course % uh if this-
this is the shopping part , right .
now the second thing you want is also for some theme park , right ?
% ah o~
okay .
okay .
yes .
a theme park for you daughter especially she 's sixteen years old
she wanted to try something thrilling .
i will recommend you for % uh this sentosa .
sentosa and-
inside sentosa we have a theme park here known as the resort world .
% uh resort world in sentosa is actually a theme park % um located inside sentosa itself .
yes .
okay .
there 's a lot of ride if i go-
if we go there .
yes correct .
yes it 's actually a universal studio located inside the sentosa .
and this universal studio if you are coming in the month of september ,
let me just help you up to see the ticket itself whether how much it 's gon na cost you
and of course travelling from your hotel to universal studio .
% uh if you remember just now there is a train station called ew seve~
% oh sorry % um ne seven , that is from the little india .
it will actually takes you to the harbourfront % uh where the last stop is
then you 'll have to change % uh this sentosa express to take you into the universal studio , right .
okay .
yes .
okay .
so that is a lot more easier
not so much of % um walking to be done .
so click next on your screen right now you are seeing
% uh it 's actually a calendar of universal studio .
now since you are coming in the month of september and it falls on the twentieth
which is a thursday .
% uh if you go on a thursday
the % um ticket will be a lot more cheaper if you go on the twentieth .
but if you go on the twenty first it will be a little bit more costly now
because the friday is consider as a weekend rate .
so weekend rate means % uh peak rate
so you 'll probably have to pay a fee more expensive .
okay .
okay .
yes it 's more expensive .
yes .
so you can see % uh on the screen itself
the non-peak is actually sixty eight dollars for adults
and child is you have to fall in the range of between three years old to twelve years old .
so your daughter is sixteen years old i 'm sorry you do not-
% uh you are not entitled for the children .
i 'll be paying full amount .
right .
so % uh she has to go on the adult fare .
so % uh i think i guess it would be around about a hundred and thirty six dollars .
so hundred and thirty six dollars together with your two sixty -
% uh three plus , right .
so if % um you are going in onto this universal studio
% uh we also do have an express pass which is available .
now this express pass of thirty dollars is add-on to your original ticket price of sixty eight dollars .
the express pass means that you-
it actually allows you to access to a shorter queue inside the attraction .
because you know universal studio is a very % uh new attraction in singapore
so many other visitors will queue up for their rides
and by queuing it actually waste a lot of time
so a lot of them may wanted to purchase the express pass to get away from the queue .
so thirty dollars additional if you really want to jump the queue , yah .
but of course if not then you can have a full day there
which is the universal studio op~
% uh the operating hour is between % uh nine forty five in the morning
and it will end in the evening at seven .
okay .
yes .
okay .
yes .
okay .
i have a quest~
so seven p.m . will be % uh-
yes .
i have a question for you matthew .
i missed the part % um how long again from e~
is it e twelve % um the transportation-
now from your hotel -
yah , there are hotel transportation that you see on the screen is again
you can see a ne seven .
yes .
yah .
yes .
from there -
now-
% uh excuse me ,
from there how long will it take for us to get to universal studios ?
% uh in total of walking and % uh waiting for the train
it will approximately about half an hour .
half an hour ? okay .
half an hour ? okay .
at the most .
yes at the most , yah .
and how much should i pay for transportation ?
well if you are walking towards ne seven
the transportation from ne seven to the vivocity where this % uh sentosa % uh express is
is going to cost you at the most is about three dollars per person
so you pay about six dollars .
% ah okay .
% oh okay that 's fair .
okay .
yah .
then from there if you-
% uh from there you take % um the sentosa express which is also another kind of train
that allows you for admission into sentosa and then you pay three dollars more
so total six .
so in all in all you pay around about twelve dollar .
six yah twelve dollar .
okay % uh-
okay .
another question matthew .
from the train station going to universal studios
we 're going to walk it or we 're going to be in the place itself already ?
yah .
if you are taking the train it will ends you up in vivocity
which is the last stop of the train system .
and from there you have to take another train which lead you into sentosa island .
this train is only accessible from the vivocity itself .
so the connecting train is in the shopping mall of the vivocity .
so if you take the train from the sentosa express it 's only costing you three dollars .
okay .
% ah okay .
% ah okay .
yah .
okay i got that .
okay .
yah .
so from there in fact % uh if you finish your vis~
% uh what you call universal studio
you can also take back the same train to vivocity again
where you can do your shopping again .
because vivocity is also a very nice shopping mall to shop
% uh which i do n't think you will miss-
i 'll just give you % uh an idea of this vivocity here , alright .
now vivocity is up here
as you can see % um this is the screen of the vivocity .
okay .
nice place to be , nice shopping mall .
okay .
so how-
until what time is it open ?
yah .
the shopping mall actually starts at ten
and it will end in the evening at ten .
% ah okay .
yah .
so you can see getting there , there are a few ways of getting .
% uh you can see % uh the screen which is right now having by mrt ,
can you see mrt ?
yes .
yah .
so take the north east line and alight at harbourfront .
so the station that near to your hotel is called the north east line .
so you will stop at this area here called the harbourfront centre .
so only from here you take the sentosa express to the sentosa island .
so it 's quite near
the minute when you come back again after you did universal studio
you can also drop in in this shopping mall and do your shopping
before going back to your hotel .
okay .
okay .
how about the time of the mrt ,
how long % uh-
% uh well the mrt actually operates from morning
% uh it ends in the evening
the last train leaving is at twelve midnight .
% oh okay .
yah .
okay .
that 's fine .
right .
okay how about other places to go to ?
% uh other places to go to .
right the % um-
the % uh the universal studio is what you want to know more right ?
or you prefer something else ?
ya~ % uh .
yah .
yes i want my trip to be memorable , matthew .
okay .
% uh if you 're going for universal studio , if you are buying the express pass
you probably can end up in sentosa island again which is near-
next to the universal studio .
% uh you can also enjoy a beach % uh show which is very popular in singapore right now
we call it song of the sea .
song of the sea is actually located in sentosa
and i just % uh put up this for you in sentosa , yah .
so in sentosa you can see % um on your screen right now .
okay , see the sentosa ?
yes .
alright .
so sentosa is another % uh park whereby % uh you can catch the song of the sea in the evening .
it 's a very wonderful show .
it 's actually a laser show % um with fireworks and waterworks .
i just give you small outlook of the song of the sea % uh for you huh .
just give me % uh coming .
okay .
that you should not missed
because % uh the show song of the sea show , there 's a limit to the show .
% um about two thousand five hundred visitors are able to get the seat for a single show .
so for that show-
there are two shows happening in the day % uh in the evening in fact
% uh seven forty and eight forty .
additional shows only happens during the weekends , saturday .
so you can see % um the normal ticket is at ten dollars
so % uh you can catch this , that particular show before you end your trip
% uh in % uh the sentosa .
so that will fully occupy your full day in fact .
okay .
okay .
here in this place sentosa
there 's a lot of things to do there already , right ?
yes .
you see % uh from my screen here there 's a lot of attraction which are here .
% uh we have the attraction at imbiah lookout .
% uh we have attractions at siloso point
along the beach area and resort world .
so you can see the resort world is the wonder i 'm talking about of universal studio , right ?
yes .
yah .
it 's actually on the right hand side of your screen you can see universal studio .
so sentos~
universal studio is located inside sentosa itself .
so other than going elsewhere for % um-
to take your transport by wasting a lot of time to get to the destination
why do n't you % uh do the what you call the universal studio
and at the same time finish up sentosa then .
because sentosa is also a nice place to go .
% oh okay .
okay .
% uh yah .
if you have plenty of time then if you are buying the express pass
probably you can also visit the underwater world which is located inside sentosa .
but this sentosa underwater world only % um opens from the % uh nine a.m . to nine p.m .
so you have to catch that timing .
it 's actually a nice place to be .
but if you want your daughter to enjoy a little bit more
probably you can % uh put this sentosa in during the day time
and enjoy diving with the shark package in sentosa underwater .
% ah o~
okay .
can we finish that % uh-
and that will be nice .
i think one day in sentosa -
is it enough to see all the places for a day ?
if you are not going for the universal studio
i should say yes it 's enough .
% oh okay .
is my money enough ?
% uh if you 're going for universal studio then i 'm sorry .
wh~
sentosa one day together with resort world not possible .
how about my % uh money matthew ,
will be enough ?
will it be enough ?
yah if you see-
% uh if you 're not going to dive with the shark
then i have guess % uh it should be enough for % uh less than a thousand dollars , yes .
okay .
what is the good time for shopping there ?
what 's the good time for shopping ?
yes .
% uh well-
since i only have two days to spare for my vacation .
you see as i say % uh there are so many shopping centres around .
% uh the place whereby you are putting up is also a nice place for shopping .
in fact you can get lots and lots of % um clothing accessories for you and your daughter .
and even if you want to become an indian for one day
you can go to little india and % uh have something on your hand
put on the hand need to be drawn on your hand and see how it looks like to become an indian .
yah .
o~
i ha~
% ah yes i have another question .
most of the accessories or clothes are from india , is it ?
% uh they are not only from india
but because the design are mainly catered to the indian taste .
like for example if you-
% uh the indian have a little bit more on the design of the god of % uh the indian .
sometimes they also have a necklace
which been designed with % uh the indian cursive % uh floweries .
so those are the design to the indian taste
not actually made from india but some indian may have make it in europe .
they bring it back to singapore to sell it % uh to % uh
at that place .
so there are retailer shops actually open at that area
mainly catered to the indian needs
not from india .
yes .
okay .
okay .
and when we get hungry there are lot eating or restaurant -
eating place or restaurants in sentosa ?
% uh yes indeed , there are lot of restaurant which are there
you can see down here in sentosa .
if you want to enjoy the dining at the beach area
we also have you can dine indoors and outdoors .
anything you name it you can have it .
is it expensive to eat there or it 's reasonable ?
% uh if you are talking about dinning in the restaurant
then of course % uh it will be a little bit different compare to the street food
or we call it % uh the local food -
i mean the hawker centres and the food court , yah .
okay what % um-
because it 's air-conditioner
and it 's a very good environment also , is n't it ?
so you feel good-
but-
yes it is .
do they serve good food there ?
% uh yes of course .
even if you would like to try some of our local dishes like the hainanese chicken rice
they also available % uh at the hawker centre .
so if you are staying nearby to this little india
% uh there 's lot of mall which have air-conditioner food court .
you can try all those % uh local dishes at that area .
sometime if you really do n't find you probably-
% uh and also very skeptical having the local dishes , yah
there 's also a lot of western food available as well .
yes .
i see here italian and european meals they serve too .
yah .
yes .
yes .
how about this one ,
what if i 'm going to take % um the boat ?
the boat ?
yah .
it says here island now boats for over fifty .
the boat could take me to different restaurants .
% hm % oh i-
are you looking at the same page i 'm looking at ?
yes , % uh dine and shop ?
the sentosa ?
% uh dine and shop , yah .
yes .
yes .
it says here from central business district the island now boats
% uh no , i can not -
i thought boats , bought .
i 'm sorry about that .
so there 's only o~
boats .
yah that 's why
yah i do n't see any boats here % uh yah .
yah , that 's why you were quiet .
% uh ya~ yah there -
yah you are telling me boats so okay no .
no i do n't see any boats here .
so there 's no other way to go there
unless i 'm going to take the train and-
there is some other ways you can take by the mean of public transport .
you can have taxi are also available , % uh buses are also available .
% um those are the few option you can take , yah .
how how about by bus ,
how long will it take ?
by bus is approximately % um also amount about the same
about % uh thirty to forty five minutes , yah .
and how much will it be ?
% uh almost similar like the train .
so which is more convenient to take the bus or the train ?
yes ?
i will say train because-
because bus you need to stop every traffic light
the train got no traffic light
so he 's just cutting across .
okay .
but-
but you said it takes the same time to get there
if i 'm going to take the bu~
% oh i see .
the thing is % uh if you 're walking towards that station
then it takes some time right ?
yes .
if you are waiting for a bus
you just walk towards the bus stop that which is not very far from your hotel
then you take pick up the bus and go .
but it 's going to be take about thirty to forty five minutes , alright ?
% oh yes .
but if you are taking the train then is a lot more comfortable
because % uh by walking towards train % uh station there is the walking distance only .
then from the train there is no waiting time for the traffic condition .
if you are taking the buses then of course if there is a heavy traffic then you get congested
the time may drag even longer .
% ah okay .
so it 's more convenient to take the train than the bus ?
okay .
yah .
correct .
and how about if i 'm going to stay in the hotel that you showed me
% uh is it-
is the breakfast included in the package ?
% uh inclu-
i 'm sorry that is a budget hotel so no breakfast is included .
but % uh the hotel which you are staying % uh near to that particular area
if you see on the screen now
you will find that along the street here there is a lot food court or we call it coffee shops available .
coffee shops are % uh they sell coffee in the morning
% uh they sell toasted bread with eggs , half boiled egg or full boiled egg .
sometime you can also get noodles
and also if you like to try our indian style of breakfast
we call it roti prata which is made up of flour .
they fry it on the pan
and it 's quite tasty with-
if you dip it into a curry sauce .
% oh okay .
yah .
you can try this % um near to your hotel
and it 's quite cheap also .
for breakfast probably you pay around about % uh three dollars
you can get a good and nice breakfast , yah .
okay how about-
is it okay to change my money to singaporean dollars in my country or to your country ?
% uh well it-
almost everywhere is the same .
whether you change it in your place or you can change it in singapore
it 's still would be the same rate .
so it 's it's-
anywhere will do , right ?
yes , anywhere will do .
okay .
how about-
you need not-
yah you need not to be in singapore .
so everywhere i go there is a place where i could change my money , right ?
correct .
the place that you are staying % uh at little india there 's a lot of money changer as well
so you need not have to worry .
even if you are not changing that money right now
you can get the money changer at any other shopping mall .
there 's a lot of money changer at the shopping mall
so you need not to worry about your currency
it 's quite easy and convenient .
okay .
can you tell me how much is the curre~
or the rate if i 'm going to change my peso to singaporean dollar ?
well there is a website that you can estimate the exchange rate
but % um you can not use that rate as the fix rate .
so it changes everyday ?
yes change everyday .
okay .
it 's okay .
yah so you have to check it everyday .
okay so-
okay .
and what are the places that i should not go to ?
the places to avoid .
yah .
yah .
% uh well there is % uh-
no , there is no places that you should not go to
but % um of course % uh dark areas behind the shop houses
you should not try to venture .
okay .
the dark places behind the shop houses is actually not good .
but walking along the main street doing the shopping % uh it 's fine ,
it 's quite safe here in singapore .
okay .
so when we get hungry since we do n't have % uh breakfa~
yah .
yah .
you did n't have to worry because along the way you can have burger kings , kfc
which is kentucky fried chicken , mcdonalds is everywhere
fast food is available .
even if you are staying in your hotel
if you 're hungry intend not to get out from your hotel
you can also call % uh mcdonald , they will deliver to your hotel .
okay that will be great .
so-
correct , that is very convenient .
% oh it 's very convenient .
% uh need not to worry you will not die on hunger .
anyway i 'm just go-
i 'm planning to stay for a day or two
so i 'm going to make the most of it .
i 'm going to make the most out of it % um right ?
but how about the do 's and don'ts
what are the things that i supposed to do and things that i 'm not supposed to-
not to do rather in your country ?
well % uh ya~
yah i guess % uh you have heard a lot things
that what you should ask , what you should do , what you should not do
but % uh one thing just bear this in mind treat singapore as your home
% uh that will be good enough .
because if you treat singapore as your home
deffinitely there is no other places that you should-
what you should do and why you should not do .
because % uh if you treat singapore as your home
you definitely do n't throw litters in your home , right ?
you do n't throw papers at your home right ?
you do n't spill all over the places at your home , right ?
so you treat singapore as your home then nobody will fine you
then there 's nothing that you can not do .
okay .
yes .
yes .
% ah okay .
so-
but as far as if you i am-
i guess you are not a smoker , right ?
no , i do n't smoke .
yah .
then that 's fine because
smoking in singapore there is-
it 's not a ban but % uh certain places are prohibited from smoking .
so sometime when your friends tell you-
say that there are certain things that you should not do in singapore where one of them is smoking .
no smoking is allowed but not in public places
places like places at bus stop you are not allowed to smoke ,
places in shopping mall you are not allowed to smoke .
the reason is because they want to make sure that you know
% um you have to protect the interest of the public .
if you are smoking the smokers will not % uh have as bad % um % uh influence
compare to the one who is not smoking , right ?
because their second hand smoke will cause more damage to the non-smoker .
but there are-
so that was the reason why we have restrict them from smoking in the public area .
% oh but there are places where they could smoke , right ?
yes there is .
% uh so long it 's at the open air and it 's not in-
and it 's away from the crowded area it 's fine .
and now you are asking about the exchange rate
it 's on your screen right now .
you can see this is how the exchange rate goes right now .
% uh okay .
okay .
okay .
one peso is to-
yah .
so you-
twenty cents .
twenty nine cents .
twenty cent .
okay .
so how about the people there , diverse culture right ?
so are the people in singapore friendly ?
% uh yes .
they are very friendly , they are able to-
most of them are able to speak english .
so if you use english as % um the communication language
there should n't be a any problem
even from getting from one place to another
most of the places are written in english
it is quite easy to understand .
% oh , that 's great .
yah .
so it won't-
i wo n't have a hard time communicating with singaporeans , right ?
no definitely not .
if % uh you do have give me call i will definitely help you up .
okay that 's great .
% ah okay .
and how about other outdoors activity
so i could choose my itinerary if i 'm going to travel on september twentieth ?
so i 'm thinking if i 'm going to take or if i 'm going to go to universal studios
or if i 'm going to go to sentosa park .
how about your safari ?
i heard that you have a safari in singapore .
yes we do have a safari here in singapore
the most popular one is we call it the night safari .
the night safari in fact is something like a night zoo
and it 's coming up on your screen right now .
this % uh night zoo in fact showcase you about the % um night animals .
and during the night time most of us are in bed sleeping
we did n't know what is going outside in the nature .
what sort of animal are very active during the night time
compare to day time like the chimpanzee are quite active during the day time , right ?
yes .
so you can see a lot of chimpanzee are very active
but during the night time most of the chimpanzee are sleeping just like us .
but how much will it cost me to go there ?
well there are some public buses which will take you there .
if you are staying near to that particular place
you can go there yourself by public transport
or you can also pick up their express buses there .
you can see % uh getting there which i 'm gon na click right now .
and you can see these are some the pickup points % uh from the city area .
from the city area means from the nearby area .
so since you are staying at little india
the nearest place to pick up will be at hotel rendezvous .
okay .
hotel rendezvous .
so % uh you can just take a walk from your hotel to hotel rendezvous
it 's about another % uh ten minutes you should be at the hotel rendezvous .
or otherwise you can also pick up the % uh train system % uh from there .
% uh you can see if from here % uh , right .
the mrt station , you can take the mrt towards that area
or you can even take the buses from here .
you can see that the bus service number % um nine two six
and nine two seven , nine two six and one seven one .
it is located quite near to your hotel .
so you can pick up those buses and go to night safari also .
% uh it says here it takes thirty to forty minutes to get there .
correct .
it 's thirty to forty minutes
because the bus need to travel from your area
which is the % uh the centre of the singapore all the way towards the north area
it 's approximately around about that time , yes .
how about % um going back ,
will it be difficult to go back to the hotel right after the safari tour ?
n~ % um .
no .
in fact the buses are available until twelve midnight
the train system also available until twelve midnight .
so if you want to-
if you would not be able to catch those two you can also catch a taxi
which is also available the last mean of transportation to go back , yah .
but i wo n't have m~
and to get a taxi -
i would n't have money for taxi .
do n't worry ,
mostly the taxi fare if it 's you are taking taxi
probably it will cost you around about % uh thirty five dollars .
% oh that 's expensive .
right .
yah .
but otherwise you can just leave a little bit early
just % uh before eleven you can leave .
but usually if you go to night safari
we usually goes around about five thirty or five p.m .
because night safari is open at seven
but % uh when the drive bus journey takes you there
it will be just nice for you to get around to take some nice photograph
before the night safari opens up the gates % uh for you to view .
yah .
so by the time you finish % um your attraction inside night safari
it should be around about ten .
% um it should be fine for you to get % uh to your hotel without any problem .
% ah okay .
so how long will it take for us to finish the safari tour ?
okay that % uh really depends on you .
for a normal person you will finish around about three to-
% uh three and a half hours you should be able to get done with it .
okay .
so if i want-
if we want to go there we will-
we should be there before seven right ?
yah .
correct .
okay .
how about other places ,
what other places can you recommend ?
how about % um-
well if you like nature singapore botanical garden will be a nice place to visit .
it 's actually free of charge .
and from your places to the % um-
now i got from your places to that % uh singapore botanical garden
there is also a train system available .
so if you were to see from the map here on the screen itself
you 'll find little india at that particular station over there .
so if you take the train system down % uh all the way towards-
yah the-
% uh sorry .
if you take the train system you can also lead towards botanical garden .
it 's quite easy and convenient .
okay .
okay .
% oh , okay .
so yah you can take it down all the way towards the % uh dhoby ghaut station
change the train up there or you can take the yellow % um the bras basah line
all the way one round towards the botanical garden .
so the train fare approximately i sup~
going to be around about two dollars per person .
so botanical garden will be a nice place to visit as well .
is it free of charge ?
yes botanical garden is free .
and of course % uh let me just pull up botanical garden for you , alright .
how about merlion what does it mean , matthew ?
% uh right .
% uh merlion is actually an icon of singapore .
it was only created in nineteen seventy two-
the park is created in nineteen seventy two .
the lion head symbolised the % uh founding of the island
and of course the fish body just symbolised the humble fishing village .
so % uh that was the reason why we put it together and called it merlion .
% ah okay .
right .
that is a symbol for singapore , right ?
% ah yes , indeed .
yes .
we use that to symbolise singapore .
yah there you are , that 's the singapore botanical garden
and this is- yah .
this is % uh how to get there .
you can either go by three ways , the mrt
which is the circle line which i have told you about just now .
you can see the yellow line -
it 's very nice .
yah .
and you also can get % um down by foot from your hotel
% uh to take a walk there it is not convenient
but you can take a bus directly from your hotel .
there are-
these buses here you can see via bukit timah ,
that will be the buses available for you to pick up to the singapore botanical garden .
and it opens during the morning five a.m . all the way to twelve midnight .
but % uh if you are visiting singapore botanical garden
you should not miss the national orchid garden .
it 's a very nice garden % uh with lots of beautiful flowers .
i guess your daughter and you will be enjoying the photography session
inside the national orchid garden .
yes .
yes .
so there is a fees for you to pay in order to get admission ,
again it 's five dollars per adults and children have to be below twelve .
again i need to pay five dollars for her as well .
yah .
correct .
if you are going into the national orchid garden .
if you are not then the admission for the botanical garden is free of charge .
okay .
will it be okay to take photographs or to take our pictures there ?
yes of course .
that 's the reason for visiting attraction , right ?
% uh you can take-
yes .
but some places it can-
there are only-
there-
yah there are some places like the night safari .
the night safari % uh photography is allowed
but flash photography is not allowed .
% uh because during the night time some flash light from the cameras may harm the animal
so it may cause the animal to run into danger .
so that is the reason why flash photograph are not allowed inside the night safari .
% oh i see .
how about from the airport going to the hotel that you 're talking about , you 're recommending ,
how long will it take from the airport going to the hotel ?
yah .
% uh it will approximately about half an hour to forty five minutes , yah .
so we could take the bus or the train as well ?
i will suggest you to take the train
it 's a lot more easier .
okay .
so if we 're going to take the train from the airport
it will take thirty minutes you said ?
yah thirty to forty five minutes .
because the minute when you % uh get out from the airport
the train system from the airport is to this station called tanah merah interchange
whereby you have to walk across the other platform
to pick up the other train towards to your hotel .
so-
thirty to for~
how long-
how long if you 're going to walk it from the airport ?
not it 's % uh-
from the airport there is a direct train from the airport to the tanah merah interchange
which is % um about five minutes of % uh mrt ride , yah .
% oh so it will not be difficult to locate-
no .
okay .
not it 's la~
and not difficult to locate .
and how much will it cost again from the airport going to the hotel ?
from the airport to the hotel it 's approximately about two to three dollars
because you need to deposit one dollar additional for the ticket .
it will be refunded to you immediately after you get exit from the train station
and get a refund from the machine by slotting in the ticket back into the ticket machine .
it will give you the refund of the deposit of the ticket itself .
ok~
okay .
and from the hotel it takes us thirty to forty minutes
if we 're going to take the train going to sentosa and universal studios right ?
yah inclusive of this waiting time or waiting for the % uh train to come
waiting for while you 're walking .
so that is % uh taking into consideration .
but is it confusing to read your maps or-
no it 's quite easy to read our maps .
if you see the map here which is on the screen right now .
you 'll find that the little india is there
that 's where your hotel is right ?
yes .
do you remember ?
yes .
yah right .
so from little india if you were to see it 's quite near to bugis
and bugis is the one-
that is the one that you see on your map
it will leads you all the way to changi airport .
can you see changi airport ?
yes .
on the right hand side which has a number three there .
yes .
so changi airport has % um a train system which will lead to tanah merah
you can see tanah merah there
and that is an interchange that you have to change a train just by walking across the platform .
it will takes you all the way down % uh towards the % uh what you call , % uh the bugis area
where you can walk towards your hotel .
your hotel is in between little india and bugis .
so it 's quite near , you do n't have to worry .
okay .
it 's near .
and that 's the o~
changi is it ?
changi ?
yah .
yes % uh changi airport .
changi airport is the only airport that you have , international airport ?
we-
yes , this is the international airport .
we do have three airport but this is the only airport which % uh have % uh flights coming in from-
% uh passenger flights coming in .
the other airports are mainly for military use and also meant for private jets
and not for big % uh passenger aircraft .
and one more thing ,
what do you suggest
% uh should i reserve or my booking online on a-
if i 'm going to stay in the hotel and-
or-
yah .
yes i will suggest you to get it done % uh from the internet itself
because % um only when confirmation are there then they will give you the room .
okay .
and from the hotel there 's a lot of places
if we 're going to walk it we wo n't get hungry , right ?
% uh no definitely not .
you-
there 's a lot of % uh food court , coffeshops are available , restaurants are also available
so % uh do n't worry .
% ah okay .
and-
food everywhere .
and lastly , if i want to see the temple
i could see the temple along the way that you said a while ago , right ?
yes .
yes , correct .
okay .
anything else that you would like to recommend matthew before i go ?
well you only have two days so i have given you the choice
i have given you four choice to choose .
okay .
you 're very helpful .
right ?
you are most welcome .
it 's my pleasure .
okay .
and i will visit your country on september .
thank you .
i hope to see you soon .
and should if you have any more query you can % uh-
feel free just to drop by me again
% uh i 'm happy to share it with you again , yah .
alright .
alright .
have a good day , matthew .
bye .
same to you .
yah-
alright , bye bye .
bye .
hi , good morning .
hi , good-
my name is mathew .
yah , good morning .
% uh i 'm sorry .
% um i did n't mean to % uh cut you off there .
% uh but what 's your name ?
my name is mathew , i 'm the tour guide three
% uh speaking to you right now .
how can i help you today ? and-
how can i help you today ? and-
% oh well , hi there mathew .
i 'm participant number forty eight and my name is ralph .
and i 'm planning to % uh have a short trip % uh in singapore .
i was hoping you guys can help me out .
alright .
% uh firstly , can i know when will you be travelling to singapore ?
i 'm looking at next week ,
% um saturdays and sundays .
saturday and sundays ?
and do you have any budget in mind that you like me to assist you accordingly
to the budget you % uh propose ?
well , i 'm looking to spend up to % uh one thousand us dollars ,
but any savings % uh would definitely % uh % um-
i mean % uh % um be very help~
i mean i 'll be very happy if you guys can % uh help me % uh to % uh save some .
alright .
% uh first thing % um you need % uh-
do you need a hotel to say in singapore , right ?
or you have your planning of your own hotel ?
mo~
most likely because % uh i mean to be honest with you ,
% uh this will be the first time that i 'll be % uh visiting the country .
so i do n't have any of friends there or relatives .
so , well , you know i may have to % uh look for a hotel .
if you can help me out to find a % uh better hotel ,
that will suit my budget , that wil be great .
alright .
okay , usually % uh you plan to travel by-
the means of public transport ; like the train and the buses ?
or you prefer to travel in a little comfort with taxi ?
well ,
that would really % uh depend .
% um how much is a taxi cab there ?
alright , in singapore most of the taxis are run by metre .
% uh the maximum it will go from one place to one end of singapore to the other end ,
will cost you around about forty singapore dollars to forty five dollars .
% um can you % uh tell me the % uh equivalent of that to % uh us dollars ?
% um usually in singapore , we only use singapore currency .
so if you were to use us currency ,
you probably have to multiply by one point two .
so the exchange rate is one point two , huh ?
correct .
okay , that 's very expensive .
then we go by the mean of public transport ,
which is the train system and the bus system will be good .
so you have buses and trains ?
yah .
okay .
right .
% um but for a first-timer like me % uh would it-
i mean % uh , you know , i 'm just % uh afraid that it may be difficult for me % uh
to % uh use your public transportation .
no problem , i 'll assist you out .
and i 'll teach you how to go around .
and % uh before i proceed , i need to find a few things from you .
one is , % uh what do you have in mind % uh when you % uh come to singapore ?
you like to visit some of the attraction or theme park ,
or you prefer to see some nature ,
or you prefer to do a little bit of shopping on electronics or you buy something to give back home for your families ?
in fact , there , i will have to consider % eh your needs ,
so that i can place you at the right hotel where you will save up on transportation cost ,
and also % um for food wise , where can you pick it up % uh as well .
so , that was the reason why i 'm asking this question right now .
okay .
well it 's a small county .
% um was hoping to do % uh-
well , i was hoping to % uh maximise my visit there , so
all those things that you mention i 'm all for it .
just as long as % uh you can provide % uh itineraries for % uh those ,
for that two-days stay .
% um but % um i was % uh thinking of % uh visiting % um , you know , historical landmarks ,
if you have one .
and i 'm an outdoor type of person ,
so if % hm theme park is nice .
% um if you have % um beaches and resorts , i would to love % uh hear % uh the rates as well
% uh for those places .
right .
now % um for you budget if you are going for a thousand dollars % uh in singapore ,
i 'm very sure that you will not be able to get % uh a good beach resort .
% uh and transportation wise from the beach to any of the attraction which you would like to visit ,
is not advisable , because % uh the transportation wise is not very convenient from the beach area .
so probably you will have to look at % um maybe taking somewhere in the city area ,
where the train systems are available and they will be probably helpful for you
to move around in singapore % uh at % uh a budget cost .
really , huh ?
yah .
% um well first things first % uh
let me % uh see-
i mean % uh i want to % uh know how much are the % uh hotels are for-
to singapore on average .
okay .
right .
% uh right now i 'm actually % um i guess you are having a screen share with me right now , right ?
yah .
alright , now can you-
that 's i thought , you know , of asking you about the hotel ,
because % uh i 'm working at the % uh map right now .
alright .
first thing % uh i would like to just put it up to you that % uh there is a hotel which i 'm looking at right now ,
which is called hotel eighty one bencoolen .
and this is actually a budget hotel .
% uh they have no breakfast in this particular hotel .
but % um next to the surrounding of the hotel , there is a lot of , we call it food court or coffee shops , are there .
okay .
so that means that in the early morning , instead of getting your breakfast in the hotel ,
% uh which is % hm % uh which they do n't serve % uh breakfast ,
you can pick it up at the next door where the coffee shop is .
we call it coffee shop is basically because in the early morning and throughout the day ,
they do serve coffee , tea , and , you know , cakes , % uh toasted breads .
those things you can get it there at a very cheap rate .
but are they open twenty four hours a day ?
% uh some of the coffee shops do open twenty four hours .
some of them they only operate from the morning
as early as six in the morning .
and then they probably finish their business
in the evening at around about nine to ten , yah .
okay .
so % uh with this hotel , i 'm pretty much % uh just % um renting a room ?
so-
% eh renting a room is % um we do n't have those kind of % uh-
we do have those backpackers ' room , but it 's not advisable to have a visitor first time .
you try on the backpackers ' room .
probably you get-
% uh i 'm sorry , what was that room again ?
bed ?
backpackers .
we call it a backpackers .
% oh backpackers , okay .
yah , correct .
so where do you suggest ?
probably a hotel like this % uh hotel eighty one at bencoolen , that would be good for you .
you can see that the room rate wise is about hundred and ten dollars per night .
and it is not really very costly .
if you are staying for two-night , you probably pay around about two hundred and twenty dollars at the most .
but what do i get for % uh a hundred ten a night ?
you know , just the stay ?
so and-
yah .
yah just the stay .
you can see this is the hotel .
you can see it from your screen right now this is how the hotel looks like .
alright , the bed is slightly a little more comfortable .
right , and-
well it-
they looks comfortable , but i-
to be honest with you , i think it 's kinda expensive .
yah .
yah .
no , in fact is hundred and ten is quite cheap % uh if it 's located at the city area .
and moreover , you can see from yourself from the screen right now , i 'm loading it up for you .
and if you see % uh carefully on the map itself ,
it is quite accessible % um to the public transport .
okay , so this is located at the % uh main city ?
yes , located in the city area where % uh most of the public transports are available .
okay , sounds good .
okay , you can see from the map right now , % um the blue % uh icon which is here ,
% uh it 's hotel eighty one bencoolen .
it 's a two-star hotel .
if you 're going for three-star , then it will be a lot more costly .
so that 's why you 're going for a budget hotel .
yes , you can see down there it 's written down there , this is a budget hotel , right ?
compare to the % uh normal hotel you 're looking at .
so and it 's not only that , it 's close by to the train system .
there are three kind of train system which is available there , you know , within the walking distance .
so dhoby ghaut is the station which have three trains linking together .
the cc one and ne six , ns twenty four .
% uh these are the kind of trains connecting train .
that means at these area , it 's an interchange of trains .
so if you were to travel going to % uh northeast , you have the northeast line there .
if you are going to % uh north-south , then you have the north-south train station .
you also have the cc one which is circle line train system .
so it 's all nearby and not only that you can also % uh take a walk towards the ew twelve which is on your map .
this is the east-west bound train .
it 's very simple to identify .
% uh ew means east-west .
twelve means station number twelve .
so this is % uh how nearby it is % uh to your hotel , walking distance .
so probably from east station % uh from the station , dhoby ghaut station , to your hotel ,
probably about % hm ten minutes ' walk .
and then maybe from your hotel to the east-west bound train ,
another fifteen minutes walk and that 's it .
okay .
okay .
what are the other things they offer at the hotel ?
i mean do they have % uh a pool , casinos ?
right .
% uh no , this is a budget hotel .
so definitely you would not be having % uh those kind of facilities % uh like the swimming pools and all those staff .
because if you are looking at swimming , then you have to
have a full-fledged hotel or something like a three-star or four-star hotel .
then you 'll have all those facilities .
okay .
% uh how about food ?
% um i mean do they serve any type of % uh dishes , if-
i mean , if i get lazy % uh to % uh get out .
right .
% eh in fact this hotel do not serve % uh food .
they only % uh rooms available only .
you can see it from here , these are the hotel facilities here .
% uh there are bars and pubs which are there .
but % uh-
but-
okay , but % uh can i request them to % uh fetch me some food ?
yah .
you see % uh in singapore here it 's quite convenient .
if you are quite hungry and you do n't wan na get out from the hotel room ,
you just need to do is to dial % uh for their food like mcdonalds % uh kentucky fried chicken ,
% um , you know , pizza huts .
and those are available through a phone call away , yah .
okay .
% um but is it the same % uh with all % uh-
with all those % uh food chains % uh
are there any % uh delivery charges ?
so when the ,
% uh well there is a delivery charges for some of the % uh fast food .
like mcdonalds , they do charge % uh a service charge of two dollars .
okay .
yah , additional two dollars on top of your % uh food order .
okay .
so it 's % uh quite reasonable .
it should be okay .
you can see that % uh the rooms are all so internet access , there are safe deposit box which are there .
wi-fi in public area , shops are there , % uh laundry self-service are there ,
elevators are there .
so the only thing is , it 's a budget hotel , so it does not have swimming pools and restaurants
okay .
well i got a question % uh with wi-fi in public areas .
% um so i~
% uh wi-fi is not available in my room ?
% uh wi-fi is available in your room ,
but % uh you can see down here it says internet access wireless complimentary .
that means that it 's free inside your room .
that okay , i did n't notice that .
yah .
yah .
and the laundry service , is that for free ?
no , laundry service is not that for free .
% eh you have to put-
laundry service are chargeable .
% um you have any idea how much it would cost me ?
% uh maybe it goes by % uh per unit basis .
maybe will cost you around about four dollars for washing and drying .
okay .
and one of the % uh safety deposit boxes , can you % uh
tell me something about that ?
yah .
safety deposit box usually is % uh free of charge .
usually it 's free of charge .
because % uh you can put the safe deposit inside your room .
% uh there is a small little safe deposit inside your room
okay .
yah .
well % uh the hotel seems like a good fit to % uh what i need .
% uh but got ta ask you , i mean % uh do we have any other alternatives ?
okay .
% uh yes , we do have
the other % uh hotel which is also % uh hotel eighty one % uh put up a little bit where the
% uh rochor canal road is .
there is also another hotel called hotel eighty one .
% uh let me just
bring you back here .
% oh i think ,
wait huh .
by the way , i am planning to % uh have someone with me on this trip .
so i 'm looking at % eh % um a couple 's room .
yah .
okay .
a couple 's room ?
alright .
so , you know , i mean with the hotel eighty one , the first one that you % uh showed me ,
% um the hundred % uh ten dollar fee is that for a single room or is that a couple 's room ?
it 's a couple 's room .
it 's a twin bed there or you can also request for a king size bed or queen size bed .
well , good .
okay .
yah
run this thing up .
but while you are trying to allocate that other hotel , let me just ask you % uh
i mean how 's the % uh weather there ?
is it very hot ?
yah .
yah .
% uh singapore weather % uh the temperature is ranged between twenty six degree to thirty five degree .
% uh usually highest you can get % uh thirty six ,
but we do reach thirty six sometime .
% hm okay .
pretty humid .
yah , it 's quite humid here .
okay .
right .
% um i do n't think there-
so % uh are all of the % uh rooms in your hotel are air-conditioned ?
yes the hotel rooms are air conditioner .
so you need not have to worry about
okay .
yah , i just wan na be sure i mean .
% uh i do n't wan na feel % uh thirty six degrees inside my room .
no , of course not .
okay .
okay , here we are , we have another hotel here which is a three-star hotel known as the fragrance hotel .
and let 's see whether do it % uh-
is that in the same area as hotel eighty one ?
right .
yes , it 's quite near to hotel eighty one so the room rate is about hundred dollars per night .
so it 's about ten dollars lesser only at the most .
it is also quite near , yah .
really , % uh ?
and this is a three-star hotel , right ?
yah .
okay .
so why is it much cheaper than hotel eighty one ?
so you can see it 's located-
yah .
alright , you can see that % uh fragrance hotel is a little bit outskirt % uh from the city ,
it 's quite near to the edge of the city .
then , i would say % uh going out away from the city .
% ah okay .
yah it 's located some , yah .
that is the reason why % uh it 's % uh slightly cheaper compared to the hotel that i 'm talking about just now .
and you can see there the distance from this hotel % uh to the train station
where i show you about the dhoby ghuat ,
it 's a little bit further away , is n't it ?
or do n't you think so ?
well how long % uh will take me % uh for , you know , to % uh get to that station ?
how many minutes for a quick walk ?
you-
either you can take the other station which is quite nearby , which is only the train system called it ne seven .
the ne seven is a northeast bound train .
station number seven , it 's a little india station .
you can take the train system from here .
% uh it will lead you back to that station which is called the % uh dhoby ghaut station .
the only difference is that this is near to only two station ,
that is near to three station .
% uh i would say four station .
that means there are connecting trains % uh available just at the site .
so , even you were to go to the north , you can get train easily , even you wan na go down to
% um at the west , there 's also some connecting train which is available .
so it 's like , you know , it 's quite convenient compared the % um % uh this hotel that you are staying .
% eh there is only two trains that you can pick it up .
one is a northeast line , the other one is the east-west bound train % uh line and that 's it .
so same thing % uh northeast line will takes you about five minutes ' walk
towards that station .
and ew will takes you another about ten minutes ' walk
to that particular station .
okay .
yah .
i 'm liking the sound of that .
% uh what about the % uh facilities ?
so you , huh ?
we are % uh i 'm asking about the fragrance hotel .
sorry , i can not get-
yah .
what are the facilities there ?
i do n't mind walking really .
so % eh anything % uh that will be cheaper for me , i 'm all for that .
okay .
okay , you can see that this do come with % uh-
this do come with a small little pool , yes .
there 's small little pool , restaurants are there .
okay .
yah .
and if you are coming with your girlfriends then % uh superior room will be good for you .
so , okay .
so what do i get % uh for my hundred dollar stay ?
sorry ?
what do you get your first-
your one hundred dollar stay complimentary ?
wha~
yes .
coffee will be serve to you % um i guess breakfast .
i-
maybe i let you see whether there 's breakfast for you .
okay .
i guess hundred dollars is not with the breakfast .
% uh we 'll wait and see .
% uh no i do n't think there is breakfast here .
but they do have a restaurant inside the hotel , right ?
% uh no .
they do have breakfast .
they do have breakfast if you are taking the executive deluxe room .
the superior rooms are not with breakfast , yah .
% oh i see .
okay .
yah .
so hundred dollars is pretty much the % uh stay , right ?
no .
hundred dollars , yah .
it 's for the lodging , right ?
correct .
okay .
but , what type of food do they serve there ?
yes , it 's for the lodging .
so you can
% uh coffee , tea % uh some sandwiches are there .
% uh that 's it .
and not like this .
% um are there any % uh specific dishes ?
% uh i mean do they serve indian food , chinese dishes ?
that is usually the-
in the hotel wise , the restaurants are there .
% uh usually they serve the local % uh we say the % uh ancient asia % uh deli~
% uh food that is % uh in southeast asia , yah .
okay .
yah .
% uh % um outside of the hotel , are there any other % uh restaurants that i can choose from ?
they-
outside , yah .
outside your hotel % uh there is a chinese restaurant % uh across the road .
then if you love indian food , indian curry ,
that you have to walk across to that train station that i 'm talking about .
the whole street there call serangoon road ,
in fact is % um a place whereby % eh % uh most of the indian food are sold there .
% uh you can of course take a walk there if you want to .
you can see on this part of the area , you 'll find that % um serangoon road .
can you see that serangoon road ?
i 'm not sure % uh what to look for .
no , do you-
can you see the ne seven ?
yah i am seeing the map and % uh yap serangoon .
yah , ye-
the ne seven in the serangoon road % uh which is here .
yah , this is the whole street whereby a lots of indian food are sold here .
lots of % um indian related accessories and also % uh indian goods
which you % uh will like to take a look at or to purchase them .
and this is a very good street for % uh tourist as well .
okay .
alright .
okay , that sounds interesting .
% uh yah .
yah .
so instead of going very far away , staying in a nice hotel in the city ,
if you stay nearby here , quite near to the station ,
and also near to little india where you can shop around to found out more
about the indian community while living here .
and , not only that % uh goods which are related to the indian community ,
may have not come from indian itself , it may % uh came from europe .
people who are staying in europe , but they are indians .
they pre~
% uh they made those things and then they bring back to singapore and sell it here .
okay , interesting story , mathew .
yah .
% um i think i would love to % uh stay there in fragrance .
okay .
yah i mean i love indian culture , so i definitely % uh would enjoy my stay there .
so-
okay , so hotel wise , i guess this would be your choice , right ?
yah .
% um from here then we will go to your attraction , right ?
okay , cool .
% uh right .
so i guess % uh you had heard about % uh % uh you said-
just now you were saying that you love % uh theme parks , right ?
yah .
% uh so % uh the next one that i 'm gon na tell you is about a theme park
which is % uh also accessible % uh by train to this theme park .
so this theme park , the name of the theme park in fact is called the universal studio .
% oh you got universal studios there , huh ?
yes .
we have universal studio here in singapore .
so % um just give me a minute and let 's pull out the universal studio for you , huh ?
okay .
so this will not be a package deal , right ?
% eh no , usually-
it will not be a package deal , because
you see the thing is you have a limited of time in singapore ,
you only have two days .
and with these two days , you try to see % uh what is % uh most interesting here .
then to hop a few places whereby you kinda physically enjoy it .
so-
okay , just making sure .
i really do n't want to have any % uh package deals huh .
% uh yah .
yah , i see-
% uh i do n't think you will like to go to a place whereby , you know
% uh when you reach there , okay % uh five minutes we have to go .
that goes to another place .
then you know it 's like you do n't visit the place at all .
you just go there and % uh see the entrance and then they leave .
yap .
yah , true .
i-
alright .
so , basically make full use of your time when you are here in singapore .
if you % uh in the later part if you have more budget and you wanted to stay for a longer time ,
then that you can probably consider at the later part .
alright .
so probably if want to catch the latest in singapore ,
the universal studio is one of the place that you should not miss
% uh if you like theme park .
so here we are then you can see this is universal studio .
and we have the transformer here , the transformer ride .
and transformer ride in fact is % uh quite new .
and % uh this % uh transformer has been showing in % uh new york .
% uh but of course % uh singapore is having one of the best of all .
so i 'm gon na show you right now % um how to get there , what are the ticket price which is involve , yah .
okay .
right .
now , how to get there % uh to universal studio ,
in fact from your hotel , if you were to take % um the northeast train ,
which we call it the ne seven
from your hotel you remember , right ?
the ne seven .
yah .
now , the ne seven will take you all the way up to % uh the station here call the harbourfront .
harbourfront .
okay , if you were to see below % uh down here ,
you can see northeast line , mrt rail , okay ?
now the northeast line mrt rail-
okay , if you look carefully you will find that this is % uh little india , right .
okay .
can you see from the screen ?
yah , i 'm still following .
okay .
so from you screen yeh , the ne seven is the nearest train that you can pick it up .
so it 's lit~
% eh the station in fact is known as little india .
you take the train all the way from little india to the harbourfront
which is here .
okay .
the number six , right .
okay .
so that will be the ending part of the northeast line .
and from the northeast line , the same building itself ,
there is a sentosa express which is there .
but the distance from your little india to harbourfront ,
approximately fare for the train ride per person is about three dollars .
three dollars ?
and how many % uh minutes is the trip ?
yah , three dollars .
then-
approximately about ten minutes from here , huh .
okay .
so from this % uh station when you get out from this station ,
in fact it 's also known as harbourfront .
but the building name is known as vivocity .
vivocity .
alright .
revo ?
% uh v i v o .
v i v o , okay .
vivo , okay .
yes .
yah , from the vivo station , there is a sentosa express
which % eh will lead you into universal studio .
is that the train ?
yes , there is an express train , we call it the sentosa express .
if you will take a look here , on your map-
on your screen again , you can see sentosa express .
can you see the screen right now ?
well % eh i think you closed it , that 's all .
still clicking .
yah , alright .
so from your screen , you can see sentosa express
which is located in vivocity level three .
you can pick up the sentosa express to this station called waterfront station .
this sentosa express only goes into sentosa island
and with % uh universal studio is located inside this sentosa island .
and it 's run by the organisation called the resort world singapore .
so resort world is also part of sentosa ,
so you have to take that train to the % uh universal studio
and the station to alight is one station away only which is known as the waterfront station , alright ?
but for this admission , you will have to pay an admission fees of three dollars .
three dollars for the admission .
if you wan na save up some money , again
% uh you can always do a morning exercise by taking a walk into the sentosa island
which you have to pay an admission of one dollar .
okay .
okay .
yah , so there are-
% oh by the way mathew , do i have to % uh pay for the sentosa express ?
% eh yes , of course .
% uh you wil~
% uh are you with me on the screen right now ?
can you see the sentosa express there ?
yah .
now if you-
it states down there take sentosa express % uh to
% uh located on level three vivocity lobby l
and alight at waterfront and the flag fee of three dollars apply .
% ah okay , alright .
okay so-
so that means that you have to % uh % um pay the admission fee
% uh at the % uh train
% uh at the sentosa counter .
alright , so from little india to vivo % uh mall ,
that 's three dollars , right ?
so they will get-
correct .
and then-
no , they-
yah , approximately , yes correct .
and then from vivo to % uh sentosa ,
% uh it 's another three dollars , so six dollars all in all ?
and then i would have to % uh pay another three dollars for the entrance fee ,
that is if i % uh i mean that is if i wanted % uh a quick ride , right ?
yah .
yes .
correct .
yes .
yes , correct .
okay , but if i just plan to a walk , it 's about a dollar , okay .
yes , yap , in total it 's about , yah .
yah .
yes , correct .
okay .
yah .
so % uh that is possible if you choose either one of them , you see .
if you wan na take it % uh take a ride in the comfort manner ,
if you 're walking all the way to get sweat in the early morning ,
% uh you wan na take a ride quickly to the universal studio ,
you just pay the three dollars for the admission at this sentosa express .
then , of course that is a lot more convenient .
well , of course % uh if you choose too , % um % uh , okay .
if you choose % um to take the pub~
direct public buses % uh only applies for foreigners ,
% uh you can pick it up at bencoolen street or bencoolen 's road which is quite near to your hotel .
but you have to go to the correct hotel .
so % um you can see % uh on your map right now % uh under universal studio ,
free shuttle service .
that provided if you are staying % uh nearby to that particular area .
okay .
yah .
let me see from here .
% um that 's by seeing the opportunity , huh ?
okay , now % um from the bus schedule itself ,
it is seems like you can only pick up % uh this shuttle service ,
at summer view hotel which is not far walking distant from your hotel .
but there is a timing for you to catch if you want to % uh have a pick up from there .
okay and % uh that bus goes straightly to % uh the theme park ?
yes , it go directly to the theme park .
how much will cost me ?
okay , let me see % ah .
alright the universal studio % uh buses , is actually free of charge .
% oh really , huh .
yah , but you have to walk to that particular hotel .
% uh how many minutes % uh do you think is the walk ?
it 's approximately about ten minutes .
if you were to see just now at the fragrance hotel ,
and i show you the map again .
okay , now can you take a look at your map right ?
you 'll find that the blue % uh ho~
the blue icon which is there is your hotel .
and summer view hotel is located at this end .
here , on this side .
you have to walk cutting across % um the street itself .
then you will reach the summer view hotel and you have to pick up that the sentosa % uh shuttle service
which is free of charge from there to universal studio .
okay .
alright .
alright .
so is walking distance still but % uh the option is yours .
% uh if you want to pick up the free shuttle service .
now , coming back , % um this is the main or way of transportation to that particular place , right .
okay .
yah .
and of course % uh next thing is you 'd like to know
how much is the ticket for the universal studio , right ?
well you mention three dollars , so is there another different rate ?
no , that-
no , that is the transportation part
that you need to pay for your transportation .
% oh you mention the-
before that i have to pay three dollars entrance fee , right ?
yes , the three dollars entrance fees applies to sentosa island .
it does n't apply to the admission to the attraction called universal studio .
% ah okay , so pretty much i 'm going to an island ?
yes , correct .
so , going to % uh-
okay .
so inside the island , % um the % uh theme park is there ?
correct .
okay , so there 's another entrance fee for that , right ?
so-
correct .
okay , make sense .
yah .
so right now % um i 'm trying to % uh put up the % uh-
i trying to pull up the season chart .
and you can see % uh in a while on your screen % uh there is a universal studio calendar .
the minute when you see the calendar , just % uh let me know .
so that i can go through with you on the calendar ,
to let you see and how the price are actually work out for the universal studio .
okay .
okay .
well , quite expensive .
i have to % uh say this to you , % uh it 's quite expensive .
well , it 's % uh-
% um what does it cover ?
okay , now , % uh you are with the universal studio calendar right now ?
yah .
alright , now you can see that the-
and , yah , meaning if % uh i 'm checking the calendar
and it looks like % uh i 'll be there
on april seventh and april eighth
which is unfortunately are peak dates .
yah , on the april seventh -
now , % uh on the seventh if you are trying to go for universal studio ,
% uh you will really have to go pretty way in advance .
that means is probably you have to try your luck now
in order to make sure that you can get the ticket online .
now , % uh the ticket price , if you are really going on the seventh ,
which i would advise not to ,
but you choose to go on the seventh ,
then you have to prepare .
% uh there will be a huge crowd in the universal studio .
and if you are going on the eighth ,
then that will be slightly better .
but then you still face the crowd .
% uh but of course there is % uh the secondary way out for this ,
% uh for the peak season , we call it the peak because it 's during the weekend .
the adult fee is seventy four dollars , and of course % uh you are not senior citizen , right ?
yah .
okay , right .
now the express pass at fifty dollars that means that % um
inside the universal studio there are two kind of queues which are there .
one which you are paying for a normal ticket , you get into joining the huge long queue .
% uh the other express ticket allows you to join the shorter queue .
that means that if you purchase an additional fifty dollars % uh on top of the ticket ,
you have a chance to join at the shorter queue .
so that it cuts % uh waiting time % uh for the attraction .
so that was the meaning of having the express pass .
okay .
right , so if you were to consider of getting the express pass ,
that would be about hundred and twenty four dollars per person , right ?
so you have about two hundred and forty eight , two hundred forty eight .
plus your hotel will be another % uh two hundred dollars , so about four hundred dollars now .
so inside universal studio % uh what is being included ?
now , in fact universal studio is a theme park and the minute when you purchase this ticket ,
% uh there ar no limits as on how many times you can go on that particular ride or attraction .
okay , sounds good .
so that means that-
that means that if you like the ride so much , you can go
the second time even the third time % uh as long as you enjoy it , yah .
and if i pay the % uh express % uh fee ,
that means i get to % uh ride as soon as i can , right ?
yah .
correct .
% uh as soon as the shorter queue % uh available , yah .
okay .
okay .
so you can see , % um-
as long as my stomach can handle , huh ?
okay .
okay .
now , % uh let me just go back to the other one which is there .
now coming , i 'm gon na show you the map inside the universal studio .
now , if you are , if your screen is ready , just let me know ,
so that i can go through it with you one-by-one ,
like what is % eh there to offer inside the universal studio .
okay .
is your screen up there ?
yap .
alright , now , if you will take a look carefully onto the lost world which my % uh castle is there .
now , this lost world come % uh with % uh theme park % uh rides ,
which is required % uh the water ride .
this is the only water rides available here .
% uh the lost world if you ha-
have you watch the movie called jurassic park ?
yes , i 'm familiar with the movie .
okay , right .
so it 's actually a mock-up of the jurassic park and in a small scale sky .
and % uh do you ride-
so there are real dinosaurs there ?
% uh no , they are fake dinosaurs .
okay , just wan na be sure .
% uh , yah .
no .
of course and then we also do have the % uh if you have watched the movie called the water world ?
now , that they are there inside this % uh small green portion of % uh fireworks here .
% uh that is the show which they are showing live .
% uh part of the show , % um not the full complete show of the water world .
% oh cool .
% uh with % uh live exhibit fireworks and % um % uh interactive % uh performance
% uh right in front of the guest .
so will i able to % um meet kevin costner ?
not the original star % ah .
not the original one ?
okay .
right .
then of course if you like the % uh water rides and there is a water ride
you call the repeat adventure , which is quite nice and interesting .
it 's something like a hydraulic wave ,
that would takes you into the canal which will-
% uh let you have a very nice , enjoyable water rides , yah .
so i 'll get wet with that ride , right ?
yes , of course .
so in case if you plan to take this ride , then you probably have to bring % uh one more extra clothing with you .
okay , alright .
right .
so this is % uh the lost world .
then inside there , inside the universal studio , we also have the % um ancient egypt .
if you have catch the movie called the revenge of the mummy ?
% uh this is actually a part of the mock-up for the % uh roller coaster ride .
% uh you know the % um the mine coaster ?
% uh that is the ride which is available inside this ancient egypt .
of course % uh a few things here as well ,
inside the universal studio food and drinks are not allowed to be in by guest .
okay .
yah , you have to purchase their food and drinks inside the universal studio .
so food wise is located near to the jurassic park where the lost world is .
and it 's also located near to ancient egypt .
so those % uh you can get ala carte food % um indian food if you want to .
so it 's available there .
so food court is located at % uh the jurassic park area .
so this is-
but i 'm sure it 's more expensive than % uh your normal-
well at food court usually the food which is serve there approximately huh , i will say approximately ,
you have % uh one meal it will cost you approximately around about twelve dollars , singapore dollar .
but if i 'm gon na take it on % uh outside of % uh universal % uh studio ,
how much do you think is the % uh price difference ?
% eh well , % uh you ca n't compare the street food and the food court
inside universal studio .
because the universal studio have % um lots of facilities inside the food court .
okay .
like for example , clean environment , air conditioner , yap .
you know , % um you have % uh facilities for young children , huh .
all those things are there .
so of course % uh to have that kind of facilities % uh the price for the food of course is a little bit different , huh .
but if you take food court outside there , probably it will cost five dollars .
at the most fifty per cent more compare to-
okay , alright .
yah .
but you ca n't get any food other than the food court inside there .
so you have to take the food there .
alright .
right .
now , % uh then the other one is the sci-fi centre .
sci-fi centre in fact % uh has as you can there are so many lines which are there , the blue and the red .
now those are roller coaster track which is % uh for the % uh battlestar galatica .
% uh this is the world fastest and tallest roller coaster ever constructed .
% oh really , huh ?
i would say fastest means it complete the cycle within one minute .
% oh really , huh ?
yes .
so % uh that is a little bit different and in at the sci-fi centre , we also do have % uh the latest attraction now ,
which you see just now , the transformer .
it 's actually a three d , i would say three d , four d movie rides inside there , right ?
quite interesting .
do i have % uh pay extra to % uh watch that movie ?
no , nothing is required to be paid inside there ,
except your food and the purchases done by you for your % uh what you call souvenirs , huh .
okay .
so % uh all the things are .
the ticket price inclusive of all the rides , unlimited rides inside there .
okay .
yah .
so the other part is where you can see the new york .
and new york if you have you-
do you know the guy which is % uh producing a lots of % uh sci-fic % uh movies ?
steven spielberg .
yah of course .
yah of course , huh ?
he is very popular in his scientific movie .
now in fact for this person to produce a movie , he in fact do n't create the movie outside-
% uh not only outside % uh the premises , but he created the movie inside a theatre itself .
so you can just imagine there , you know , you have % um a strong tornado coming in .
you know he can create a tornado inside the theatre itself to film it .
so you see how wonderful he is % uh and he is been conducted inside the theatre itself .
so it 's a nice place to see and experience .
then % um the other part is % um this part here we call it the hollywood .
that is where the dance are there .
and of course lots of retailer shops are here to sell souvenirs of universal studio singapore .
and the other one which is madagascar .
if you have watch the cartoon movie called madagascar ,
that % uh is the place whereby they will be performing at the same time .
there are some other rides which are also available there .
then the last part will be the % uh far far away , which is-
if you have watch th-
cartoon movie called the shrek movie , this is one part the movie which they make into three d 's
and it 's a ride inside the % um % uh four d theatre itself .
okay .
okay .
so this is the whole thing of the % uh universal studio .
and if you were to ask me how much time it 's gon na take ,
% uh let me say that % eh since you are going on the % uh weekend ,
you % uh expected to have % uh approximately between nine thirty to five thirty in the whole day .
i would say .
to occupy your time , yah .
okay .
well what 's their operating hours by the way ?
the operating hour for universal studio for the rides is
from % uh nine thirty the gates will open , it will start from that time .
% eh the last ride will be at seven , that 's it .
% eh seven will be the closing time for the rides .
and after seven , % uh restaurants and retailer shops are still open .
% uh but no more rides are there .
okay .
% um but how about the % uh shuttle , is it % uh available twenty four hours ?
yah .
no , as you can see % uh just now the shuttle service provided from-
the free shuttle service % uh usually has a timing .
so you have to catch the timing for the shuttle buses .
the last bus left from % uh resort world universal studio will be at ten p.m .
% uh sorry , % uh yah % uh ten , sorry .
% uh ten thirty p.m. yah .
okay , sound reasonable .
yah .
yah .
so if yo~
if you wan na spend time walking along the retailer shops , you can also that too .
okay .
so , this is the time table for the resort world .
if you want catch the free shuttle bus i would say .
okay .
alright .
or otherwise the normal train systems % uh they start operating from morning as early as five thirty
and will the finish the last train at twelve midnight .
okay , i 'm interested .
% uh i may have to % uh do that .
% um obviously i have to % uh do this in the day .
% uh what are the other things i can do the next day though ?
well i plan to do some shopping , so % uh maybe you can appoint me out % uh to the nearest malls .
right .
yah .
right .
okay , now % uh so this will be occupying for your full day .
so you of course % uh you can have dinner there and % uh of course you also can do sentosa , if you want to
for the song of the sea , right ?
yah .
what 's the song in the sea ?
a song in the sea in fact is % uh laser show inside sentosa .
% uh but that again you have to take the train inwards into the beach station .
% uh let me just pull up the sentosa for you .
so that it keep you occupy for the % uh full day .
okay , right .
if you % uh to see on your screen right now , you 'll be able to see the song of the sea .
yes ?
okay .
yah , so the song of the sea is located inside the sentosa .
so if you were to take the train again , it 's free
because you had already get paid for the admission into the sentosa island .
so that train ride from the waterfront to the beach station , where the song of the sea is located ,
is free .
so you can take a ride there ,
but you have to % uh purchase a separate ticket
for the song of the sea which is ten dollars per person .
okay .
that can actually % uh makes you-
% eh that can actually % uh last your night throughout the whole programme .
from the morning all the way until at end of the day , okay ?
okay .
right .
so the same day again the minute when you are done , you can take the sentosa express
from the beach station all the way back to the vivocity .
or you can also take it back to the resort world , where you can take the % uh free shuttle buses
for the tourist ,
back to your hotel , right ?
alright .
okay , so that is % uh for the first day , yah ?
yap that is for the first day , i would say so .
and as i 've said for the second day % um-
okay .
you like some shopping ?
yah probably i 'll do some shopping % uh you know you already % uh give me a handful there .
so i % uh may want to % uh relax on the second day and , you know ,
probably % uh buy some % uh clothing and some souvenirs and that 's pretty much it .
electronics ?
yeh electronics , i would love to % uh-
well first from % uh what i 've heard ,
% uh singapore % uh is selling , you know , cheap electronics in the world , so-
% uh , yes .
in fact % um most of the peo~
% uh most of the visitor come to singapore , they usually like to shop for electronics .
right , and now % um for sim lim square , it will be the nearest electronic mall to-
% uh from your hotel , right ?
from your hotel .
so % um , right .
now it 's walking distance , % uh probably it takes about five to ten minutes towards sim lim square .
and % uh i just show you % uh where it 's located , so that you can easily get around .
now , can you see-
okay .
okay .
% um % hm , okay .
now you can see from % uh the station here .
% eh can you see smrt link ?
% hm , no .
% uh no , not yet is it ?
the screen is not coming up yet , is n't it ?
smrt link ?
can you see ?
yah , then you can see that there is % um free shuttle service from little india shoppers , right ?
there 's free shuttle service .
so if you want to take a walk , you can take a walk .
if you want to take the free shuttles , you can take the free shuttles as well .
but it 's % uh not very far away from your hotel , so i would guess probably by walking would be
% uh good for you and save some time .
only about five to ten minutes ' walk at the most
yes .
right .
alright .
now for this sim lim square basically is a six level of electronic mall .
they sell % uh electronics like % uh computer , notebooks % uh printers % uh % uh pda 's , tablets ,
anything you need with deal with electronics ,
there is available inside this mall .
and of course % um this mall is also very popular % uh for % uh the vi~
% uh for the tourist .
and if you were to purchase any of the item here in singapore ,
if you were to purchase % uh not only electronic , but some clothing as well in singapore .
any purchases that you make in singapore above hundred dollars on a single receipt
and you would enjoy a tax refund of seven per cent ,
% uh if you are travelling out of singapore by through changi-
this changi international airport .
so if you are travelling out from singapore through % uh coach ,
then you will not be entitle for the seven per cent rebates .
so if you were to buy any electronics or clothing , you-
please ask them to give you a tax refund form .
a tax refund form will be given to you by the retailer , if you purchase a hundred dollars and above .
right ?
% uh i 'm sorry , % uh you mention that it has to be % uh
from where ?
in a chinese airport , you mention that ?
changi international airport .
% ah okay so i-
there 's only one international airport here .
so % uh if you were to travel through singapore
by air and going out % uh through changi airport ,
then you will get the tax refund .
% ah okay .
then you enjoy the tax rebate by the , yah .
alright .
seven per cent , alright ?
yah , seven per cent .
alright , it 's cool .
in fact if you buy a notebook of % uh one thousand dollars ,
you 'll probably get % uh seven per cent back from there .
then-
and is that available for tourist only ?
yes it 's only available for tourist .
not meant for the local , alright ?
okay .
alright , so these are-
there 's a list of stalls which are there if you want to take a look .
you can see that % um this is actually a floor plan map of how % uh level one is look like .
you can see that % uh there are so many shops are there
even if you were to stand about two or three hours there , i think still not sufficient .
it 's a
and next to the sim lim square we also do have the clothing mall ,
where you can pick-up some shoes or clothes , pants , huh .
% uh your girlfriend which is going with you , % uh she can spend some time there
while you spend some time in the electronic mall .
then you meet in-between .
yah .

% uh sim lim square .
% uh next to sim lim square we have the % um albert complex , % uh .
albert complex ?
yah .
% uh let me just-
yah , albert complex yeh you can see-
% uh if you were to see from your screen right now , you 'll find that % uh this is albert complex .
and in fact % uh sim lim square is next to albert complex .

but you can also visit some tourist attraction at located at this area
where we have the kwam im temple which is one of the popular .
and we also have the hindu temple which is around at the other corner % uh within your walking distance .
so you need not have to travel to much on transportation in fact , by foot is possible also .
okay .
right .
so i guess % uh this can fully also occupy your second day .
% uh but if you really want to go to some very unique % uh having some meaning % uh about singapore ,
the merlion park is one of them that you should not miss .
but % uh % um of course the merlion you have to take the train system down to the merlion park , right ?
okay .
yah .
