hello ?
hi philip my name is matthew , i 'm the tour guide three how can i help you today ?
% uh yes certainly .
% uh firstly can i % uh find out a few things % uh from you first , % uh what are the things that % er you need , yah .
right .
the first thing is % um accommodation , do you have anything in mind for your accommodation ?
% uh in fact it 's very too low .
% um probably in a range of approximately about ninety % uh to hundred and twenty dollars .
% uh that is not inclusive of breakfast because usually breakfast is % uh for budgeted hotel especially that you 're looking at asking me about eighty to ninety dollars hundred percent you are really- you will not get any breakfast .
% uh probably around by a hundred dollars you might be able to get one .
% uh no not a hundred dollar sorry , hundred and twenty dollars .
yah .
% uh which- what are the best place to- i mean which hotel will be-
yah .
% uh orchard road will be % uh a premium place and accommodation wise along orchard road will be a little bit more % uh costly i will say .
so looking at % uh a little bit far away from the city area % uh will be fairly between your budget if you are looking at it .
but the problem is you will have to take a look at the % uh transport system nearby to the accommodation that you 're gon na put up since you are on the budget travelers you have to look at % uh those things % uh in mind .
yah .
alright % um first thing % um you like- % um when you 're in singapore what are the places that you 'd like to visit ?
% uh yes indeed .
alright .
% um in fact % uh let 's go one step at a time .
firstly % uh we settle your accommodation first , right ?
% uh for accommodation wise right now at the very moment looking at the budget we have we try to locate one hotel which is fairly % uh at that kind of cheaper rate , huh .
alright so we look one for- we look up for one hotel first , right .
% uh you are having screen sharing with me % uh right now , right ?
you can see huh , okay .
okay , let me see what % uh-
yes .
it 's actually a chain of hotel .
% uh they have a chain of hotel in singapore all over the places .
% uh in fact % uh many of these % uh hotels chains they are very good at making budget hotel for people like-
yah , people like you who can travel around .
yah i 'm going to give you % uh a out view of this hotel so that you can have an idea % uh what are the things you expect % uh .
yah , this is .
% um i have been a tour guide for whole past six years .
okay , now let 's see % uh you are planning to travel in the month of % uh-
september .
september .
okay .
september for the- yah birth~ birthday .
okay let see the ra~ rates for the hotel .
% ah , now i know why .
i guess september is a little bit more costly .
% uh the reason why because is because during that particular month % uh there is a formula one race team will be coming here for the race so hotel -
% uh right .
so the hotel room will be a little bit more % uh co~
august or october % ah ?
% uh yah .
okay , let 's see .
let me just get to- i 'm trying to get the hotel near to the transport system so that you % uh will definitely be able to fully enjoy your holiday .
yah .
yah , now you can see for your screen right now % uh it 's a lot more cheaper , right ?
now you get what i 'm trying to put across .
right .
% uh for this hotel % uh at the present moment is not inclusive of breakfast , okay .
but the hotel vicinity you should be able to get % uh what you call breakfast easily , no problem .
yah .
% um these are the- some of the screenshots of the % uh hotel premises you can see how the room look like .
the exterior of the hotel and the guest room , the bathroom and the balcony .
yah , some of them they are having balconies .
so either move a little bit downward and there you see , yah .
so reception of the hotel , interior , the entrance and the bathroom .
okay .
and these are the facility here they have inside the hotel .
% uh as you can see there is wifi which is there , complimentary wifi so you need not have to pay for the wifi .
yah .
% uh laundry services usually is % uh chargeable , yah .
% uh yah .
it 's not included but you have to pay for that .
alright .
alright .
% uh right .
so the next thing is you want to know how to get to your hotel .
am i right to say that ?
because if you know there 's a hotel like that 's % uh there but how to get towards that place that will be also another big problem for you .
right .
now % um looking at the hotel is actually located somewhere in the city area % uh that 's where you can % uh do your shopping if you want to it 's also nearby to orchard road if you want to go .
so % uh you can see the blue coloured dot which is there a big circle with a bit narrow that in fact is the hotel that hotel eighty one bugis , alright .
yah .
yah the blue one , right .
so % uh-
yah .
it 's actually along middle road .
yah middle road .
and middle road is located in the city area itself .
and of course you are very quite accessible to three % uh train system here in singapore .
% uh one is the ew twelve .
if you look onto your map that is actually % uh bugis station .
% uh ew stands for east west bound train station twelve .
correct .
now do you also like to know how to get from the airport to your hotel , right ?
because % uh budget travellers you definitely want to save % uh some money for yourself .
yes but it 's not budget terminal but i want to say is you are travelling on a budget so you definitely need % uh you need % uh a public transport to go around , right ?
right .
so if you will just take a quick look at the ew eighteen you just take note about this % uh ew eighteen is with bugis % uh station , okay ?
now i 'm going to go to another screen that has the train system from changi airport to your hotel , okay .
alright .
so can you see the whole map of the transport system ?
okay .
now if you were to look on to your right hand side you 'll find that the changi airport is on the right hand side just on three-
yes .
now the changi airport has a train system , the mrt station which will lead you all the way toward your hotel whereby it 's near to bugis .
can you see bugis on the green colour track going all the way to bugis ?
correct .
it is not actually one ride but it 's actually two rides which are there .
first ride which is from changi airport you will end up in tanah merah , you can see a green coloured dot which is here .
now you have to switch platform in order to get the train towards bugis .
alright .
and if you see there is % uh two white coloured dot which is here and that is to tell you that there is an interchange in between if you want to get connected onto a different rail .
for the yellow that we called it the circle line .
circle line stands for cc , yah .
so you are not going to use that because you 're gon na go all the way green until bugis .
so from the airport towards bugis that will takes you about forty to forty five minutes of train ride , alright ?
and for singa~ % uh for getting into the train is very simple almost like the similar one % uh in your place but % uh the thing is in singapore , here in what you need to do is you need to know the station you 're going to get down .
so when you go to the ticket counter you can % um get the ticket for the bugis % uh and you 'll get your refund % uh of the ticket at the ticketing counter .
so % uh the estimated fare will be around about two dollars sixty cents and with the deposit it will cost you three dollar and sixty , alright ?
yes there is a tourist pass but % uh if i 'm not wrong it 's a fifteen dollars % uh three days pass or it could have take arrive on between , yah .
well of course depends on you whether you really need so much or not because you hardly use % uh so much of the train can walk % uh yah because you 're only on two days with % uh- hardly spend so much , yah .
right .
the train system starts at five thirty in the morning the last train disconnect will be at twelve midnight .
right .
correct .
so if you will take the train down it will leaves you back- it will leaves you to your hotel where the bugis is yah the bugis eighty one .
right .
so at that area- in fact you are located in the middle of the city and from there % uh towards some of the shopping area nearby is % uh walking distance .
right .
so you can see % uh from your hotel towards this area here called suntec city .
now suntec city is one of the largest shopping mall in singapore .
they have % uh- there is about two hundred and seventy retail shops are there .
alright easily keep you occupying for the whole day in fact .
and next to the suntec city -
% uh i will say in the suntec city itself there is a fountain which is there .
that is the world largest water fountain and it 's called the fountain of wealth .
so if you want to catch that attraction you can also walk across towards these suntec city tower one , two , three and four .
these towers are being surrounded the world largest water fountain .
okay .
% uh yes .
in suntec city we do have it shop .
the it is known as ep centre .
ep centre .
or otherwise you can also take a train down towards the funan it mall , that 's where you can pick up some of the latest electronic gadget .
right .
right .
% uh looking at your vicinity % uh you are also located quite near to waterloo street .
the waterloo street is another % uh nice spot for tourist % uh specially visiting the % uh waterloo street temple .
alright i 'm blowing this thing up for you to let you have a look at the waterloo street , yah .
okay .
now if you were to look on to your right hand side this is your hotel .
right .
and we have the national library next to us and further up you got % uh stamford centre and of course % uh next to the stamford centre we have the % uh kwan im temple which is one of the oldest temple here and along the street .
and next to the temple there is also a hindu temple which is also a very heritage % uh temple , yah .
so in fact % uh you are also able to get access into our hawker centre .
this hawker centre in fact is referring to food court .
% uh it 's non-air conditioner so we call it hawker centre .
% uh no it 's not an open space it 's sheltered but the thing is % um it 's non-air conditioner .
% uh each individual stall are selling their food but you are- if you want you can go towards the stall and see what they are selling and then you can order from them and pick up your food from the stall holders and you can- after they have make the meal they will bring it back to your % um % uh- seats % uh to get your meal , yah .
right .
you can estimate yourself if you- you are not a vegetarian are n't you ?
alright good .
now if it 's not a vegetarian then why it is not an issue because most of the food here- % uh if you were to go to a hawker centre estimated per meal will cost you around about six dollars .
comfortably you can have one good meal with a cup of soft drink .
yah .
you 're referring to our local favourite dishes , right ?
now the local favourite dishes is known as hainanese chicken rice .
yah % uh hainanese chicken rice .
now the hainanese chicken rice in fact is also located very near % uh to your hotel if you want to try the hainanese chicken rice .
alright let 's scroll a little bit up here .
% um you can see that your hotel is located here at bugis .
now two street across the road you can see- can you see bugis street and seah street ?
can you see bugis street and seah street ?
now bugis street are very famous for the duck .
we have % uh what you call black sauce duck .
and seah street are very popular for it 's chicken .
yah .
so hainanese chicken rice % uh in fact once generated from that particular street .
yah .
so you can get the traditional hainanese chicken rice from there .
the cost of the chicken rice if it 's your normal dishes will probably cost you around about three fifty .
yah .
so if you order another cup of drinks probably about a dollar plus and then makes about to four dollar , five dollars per meal .
correct .
alright .
now i guess you have % uh just now asked me about universal studio right ?
yes everybody are very keen on universal studio .
two years back .
two year- they open two years back and % um they have recently la~ % uh this year they add-in a few more rides which are there .
and now first thing is you want to know how to get there right ?
alright .
now from bugis the direction towards that place there are a few option .
one you can take the train system towards % uh the universal studio on your own .
% uh two you can take a bus % uh towards the harbourfront okay .
now i 'm gon na just show it to you how you 're gon na move around from your hotel to universal studio , huh ?
alright .
now you can see % uh on your screen % uh right there you have public buses .
now the public buses you can pick it up from your- near to your hotel is bus number one hundred .
now that bus will take you all the way towards harbourfront .
harbourfront which is % uh one of the % uh place whereby you can take the sky- to the what you call sentosa express to the % um universal studio .
okay so you have to take note that it 's bus number one hundred , okay ?
i 'm sorry ?
% uh yes universal studio in fact is located inside sentosa .
yah .
correct .
so if you are going to sentosa and universal studio you can % uh pick it out from there .
two place .
okay let me see whether i can pick up those .
% uh one of the newest one is the transformer .
yah you should n't miss that transformer .
yes i tried the ride myself it 's very interesting and of course that also depends on individual .
you- are you having- % uh you are physically fit i guess so .
alright .
so i guess % uh that is the bus number you can take towards vivocity to get your ride on to sentosa express to universal studio .
now the other way is you can also pick up some % um free shuttle buses .
the free shuttle buses is only available at certain location .
alright % uh the place where you are staying right now- that you are staying will be at % uh the bugis it 's quite near to swiss the stamford hotel .
okay .
now swiss the stamford hotel is not far away from your hotel but you will have to take note about the timing for the free shuttle bus .
we % uh say free shuttle bus means % uh provided if you have your passport with you to prove that you are a visitor is singapore you can get a free ride on this shuttle bus , okay .
now swiss the stamford hotel , just take note this first and i will show you the location of the swiss the stamford hotel % uh right now .
okay , yah .
now take a look on the map it 's coming up right now on your screen .
right , can you see your hotel ?
alright .
now can you see this hotel here ?
correct .
so this is the location where you can pick up the free shuttle bus .
alright .
you have to walk from your hotel all the way to this hotel here to pick up the free rides or the free shuttle service to the universal studio .
alright .
so this is your transportation part .
now there is the second way that you can go .
obviously you like to know % um how much is gon na cost you for the ticket , for the admission , am i right to say that ?
i guess so huh .
everybody are very keen on what their budget .
yah .
okay , let me pull out the other screen for you and i 'll show you how to get your ticket .
now i 'm gon na pull out a chart right now .
a chart whereby the universal studio two thousand and twelve calendar .
alright .
you can see the calendar right now on your page .
yah .
correct .
now the two thousand and twelve calendar is the calendar which shows you about the % uh ticket price to universal studio .
since you are travelling in the month of august you 'll find that a lot of them are in orange in colour that means that is non-peak .
but the one which is green in colour that is peak because it 's during the weekend .
so of course weekend rate will be a lot more costly compare to the non-weekend yah .
now if you 're going during the non-peak you 'll find that the adult ticket is actually sixty eight dollars .
on the left yah sixty eight dollars .
yah .
alright .
then of course if you have two person is going then you have the one twenty , one thirty six , yah .
and of course you can see that there is an express pass at thirty dollars .
% uh what is that for ?
now the express pass actually pays on top of your % uh normal admission .
the express pass actually helps you to ease the long waiting queue time on any of the rides or attractions or movies , alright .
% uh yes , i will not say no queuing up but on a shorter queue .
on a shorter queue yah .
so you pay thirty dollars just to get away from getting % uh queuing up .
yah along and wasting your time in the % uh queuing up for the rides , yah .
right .
so this is how the price are being range , okay .
yah i 'm at the calendar .
now because % uh starting from may the twenty sixth onward it 's actually a school holiday .
it 's a school holiday in singapore .
the children- the school children has one month of this school holiday .
they made as year school holidays .
correct .
so that is the reason why this is a full green and a full rate .
now and the full rate has carry another meaning for it .
the full rate means that is super peak and you probably might not be able to get a ticket if you do not go one month in advance .
yah .
so that is the meaning of this super peak .
and there is also % um a crowds management or crowds capacities are limited inside the universal studio .
especially during the peak and the super peak % uh they only allow about eight thousand visitors inside the universal studio .
the-
% uh yes , in fact right .
so if you want to get in around that time then probably you have to pay a lot more like the super peak is seventy four you have to add another fifty you get about hundred and twenty four .
% uh yah .
a little bit costly would be on the budget huh .
alright .
now coming back i think you would like to know % uh what is there to offer you inside universal studio .
now this is another screen which is gon na come up into your computer and this in fact is the whole area of the universal studio .
the whole universal studio is of- is been designed in this manner .
yah exploring the seven zones , yah .
and this seven zones compresses of rides , movies % uh actions , alright % uh and also restaurant as well .
so depends on you .
sci-fi city .
okay we go to sci-fi city .
now- yes indeed it is a roller coaster ride .
you can see the % uh blue and you can also see the red .
now both of the stripes is known as battlestar galactica .
yah battlestar galactica .
you- have you watch the movie battlestar galactica ?
okay .
now just before the pilot got into the aircraft what did they do ?
what did they do ?
before they got onto the aircraft they were supposed to sit onto % uh a .
yah a chasing ride , right ?
so that chasing ride has actually put onto this sci-fi centre which we call the battlestar galactica cylon- human versus cylon .
we call it human versus cylon is because both of this roller coaster will start simultaneously at the same time .
so they are actually challenging their speed with one another crisscross- % uh cutting across one another and you- the whole duration is only about one minute of the ride .
% uh that 's fast .
the speed of the roller coaster is at eighty two point eight kilometres per hour .
if you are seating in car you do n't feel anything but if you are flying outside then you definitely feel a lot of impact .
then-
then we have the transformer here .
% uh we- you have- you seen the movie called transformer , right ?
alright .
this transformer is very new in universal studio and it actually give you a feeling that you are in the automist % uh fighting battles against the % um % uh the bad guys huh .
so if- yah decepticons , yah .
so-
it 's a three d in fact yes .
you are supposed to wear the glasses and of course % uh the rides will take you up and down fronting , turning , swinging , it 's very interesting .
that is one of the best i will say so far .
% uh usually it takes about five minutes and above .
a long but good and fun .
right .
% uh so this is % um-
right .
% uh smoking is prohibited at most of the sheltered area .
so- % uh no we do n't have any smoking area inside universal studio .
% uh you can't- if it 's too tempting you can not % uh smoke .
then you should stay in singapore you 'll be quit % uh smoking .
okay .
now % uh this is universal studio .
so % uh if you have done this universal studio and you have some more time % uh another place that you- that i would like to recommend you is to go to sentosa .
now inside this sentosa is % um only % uh a train ride of % uh two station away from % uh the universal studio , alright .
now % uh one of the % uh most exciting area that i will like you to go is to visit the song of the sea in the evening because the minute once you are done with universal studio % uh you would should be around about six to seven p.m . right ?
and since you have the time you should % uh make your way to sentosa and visit this song of the sea % uh which is- the show is happening at seven forty and eight forty daily , alright .
how to get there is to take the sentosa express from the universal studio two stops away and it will lead you to beach station .
and at beach station you can pick up the ticket at the ticketing counter .
it 's only ten dollars per person you can pick it up from there .
right .
so that will cover your full day in % uh sentosa .
right .
then % uh the other thing is % uh on the second day itself if you have time probably you like to do the % uh shopping % uh the-
yah .
or you can also you know take a walk down % uh to our historical sites where % uh the esplanade park is .
you can see the esplanade park % uh-
yes it 's near to the hotel so walking distance and you can also see the esplanade theatre on the bay .
% um if i reduce the size a little bit and you probably will be able to see that you are also quite near to the merlion park .
right .
ye~ % uh yes marina bay is- marina bay sands is quite near to the racing track of the formula one it 's not in front of the racing track .
yah .
so if you want to see marina bay sand then i 'm viewing you this .
right .
% uh it 's coming up onto your screen right now .
and this is marina bay sand .
now marina bay sand is also not very far away from your hotel .
so let me just show it to you where is the marina bay sand .
now if you see from your hotel towards the marina bay sand is not far away the blue one towards this one here , okay .
and if you want to go to marina bay sand you can also take the circle line which is quite near to your hotel .
you can see cc three here .
you take this cc three here it will lead you to cc four then there is another entra~ there is another train system near to marina bay sand here .
yah .
so it 's quite nearby % um to the train system you can see .
i just let you have a look again huh you can see cc four , right ?
can you see cc four ?
cc four promenade .
okay .
now i 'm going to go to the other screen % uh where the train system is .
just now when you see cc four promenade ?
this is promenade on your screen .
and from promenade to bayfront which is the marina bay sand this is the stop so one stop away .
okay .
so it 's quite nearby , accessible by train near to your hotel .
alright .
so i got to blow these thing a little bit up .
how is the traffic ?
okay .
the peak hour is usually starts from % uh morning at around about seven thirty and then around about nine thirty a.m . then the second peak hour will start at % uh five in the evening it will end at around about nine thirty .
% uh sorry , eight thirty .
yah .
alright ?
so for most of the places are quite near to your premises .
we also do have the interna~ % uh singapore international convention hall located near to the suntec city mall you can also pick up some electronics from that area .
so i hope all this information are quite helpful to you a~
alright .
so is there anything else that i can help you with ?
right .
alright , thank you .
so in case you need anymore further % uh information kindly just call us and we 're happy to help you out , right .
alright .
hello .
good afternoon .
hi carla .
my % uh- i am tour guide number three .
how can i help you today ?
okay .
so you ha~ my name is mathew .
okay .
now % uh before i actually % uh plan the thing for you , a few things that i need to ask % uh from you .
that is number one , % uh in singapore itself what are the things that you like to see most ?
you like to do a little bit more shopping , you prefer to go to theme park , or you prefer to % uh see more nature ?
because in singapore itself , it 's very famous for its garden in the city .
in fact the gar~ we call it a garden in the city .
and or you can also call it city in the garden .
so % um in fact % uh nature is one of the % uh best thing that we try to put up % uh in our- the whole island of singapore , yah .
so that depends on you where you- what aim- % uh makes you interest more .
what you like to see more in singapore ?
so i can plan it accordingly .
alright .
okay. , % uh the sentosa , right ?
yah .
% uh underwater world .
okay .
yah .
% oh the nightlife ?
okay .
yah , and i 'm on the budget mathew .
i only have like a thousand singapore dollars .
okay .
alright .
% huh , so based on the information i gathered from you , % uh i guess you ne~ you wo n't be going back to sentosa , you will not be going back to universal studio , you will not be going to jurong bird park , right ?
okay , now % uh there is a hotel which is quite % uh nearby to what i think you might like , but of course i would like to highlight to you that this hotel is located somewhere near to little india .
okay .
why huh ?
% uh not only that .
but the hotels looks slightly better compare to % uh the rest of the hotel especially two ladies % uh you are travelling on your own or you 're travelling with somebody else ?
% oh two other ladies .
i think that 's okay .
so i guess % uh this hotel here called hotel fragrance at selegie will be a nice place % uh to put up , alright ?
yah .
now let me just % uh show you the hotel first , huh ?
% oh no .
you see- % ah okay , there you are .
coming back .
so you are coming-
% uh you are visiting singapore in a month of when ?
which month was that ?
which month you do plan to come to singapore ?
which month ?
which month ?
yah .
yes .
five , si~- you only have five and six , right ?
you pi~ five , yah .
okay , two days .
and let us check out the rates on the fifth first , yah ?
right .
you need- so here we are .
we have the hotel rooms rate at one zero five .
alright .
and there 's only three rooms left now .
yup .
right .
now this hotel % uh the facility wise , as you can see while i 'm scrolling down .
you can see the exterior of the hotel , it looks very pleasant .
the reception is good .
there is also a swimming pool out there paying such a one zero five per room per night .
if you have a swimming pool , you should be very happy , because % um none of the hotel at this kind of rate will give you a swimming pool .
alright .
okay % um probably around about a hundred % uh swimmers maybe .
just looking as to the pool .
soak in the-
soak in the pool i never say can swim around , huh .
right .
as you can see the facilities % uh for the hotel % uh % uh there 's a coffee shops which are there .
% uh of course the coffee shops of course % er your hotel rooms are not inclusive of the breakfast .
so breakfast , you can either pick it up from the hotel on a separate basis .
or you can also try our local breakfast which is available % uh next to the hotel , we call it coffee shop .
usually % uh to have the breakfast at the coffee shop is a lot more cheaper compared to having a breakfast in the hotel .
yes .
% uh the coffee shop refers in the hotel is actually something like a small restaurant .
% uh if you wan na take a look , i will pull it this thing up .
you can see % uh down- up on your screen % uh there is the restaurant which is there .
that is what we call the normal coffee shop in the hotel .
but % uh coffee shops outside the hotel is a bit different .
% uh let me just pull out % uh some scene of the coffee shop in singapore and let you have an idea of what the coffee shops we are talking about , yah .
yah .
% oh is it , yah .
hundred and five for- per day it 's not for-
okay , now for-
for one zero five , your room is like for two person .
that means that for tw~ yah .
so that 's why .
so you have to add one more room you do n't kick out him .
or maybe there 's another way .
you can make him- you can make the additional person sleep on the floor .
no i did n't say that you assumed .
yah .
% uh i re~- i guess this you better check it out with the hotel itself .
because there 's a re- you can see from here on your screen that the bed type can be either one queen sized bed or two single bedded .
subject to request availability of the hotel .
say if you ask for a queen sized bed , probably three person can squeeze in .
but % uh-
% uh that-
yah , or the other one can get % uh one more additional room .
but % um then you take turn to sleep on a bigger bed .
% uh yes , i would say because , you can see that % uh you were not be able to get such a good hotel rate .
i can show you some other hotel as well , but you will find that the hotel is a lot more % um expensive compare to this one , yah .
either- % hm yup .
% oh no .
okay , let me see what i can get .
i pull out another hotel which is % um near to that particular area and you can see % uh from here the rate , how much it 's gon na be .
yah .
huh ?
it 's right-
yah .
% uh yes .
i 'm putting you up near to the area .
% uh not cheap lady , but you 're smarter in controlling your budget , yah .
here you see ?
you can see down here how much is gon na be .
yah , compare to the one that is there .
how much is gon na cost you ?
% uh same thing % uh to that particular hotel , you still have to kick him out .
okay , now- so we first go for the fragrance hotel , yah ?
now-
okay , so we go for this one .
by now i 'm gon na show you where is it located , so that you have an idea what i 'm gon na talk to you about , alright ?
right .
so if you see on your map right now you will find that the hotel which you are gon na put up will be fragrance hotel at selegie .
and this is not far away from bugis .
okay ?
and you can see there are two trains % uh network % uh located nearby to the hotel .
one of the train is called the little india which is a northeast train .
station number seven .
you can see the magenta in colour , right ?
that is the northeast line .
and the other line is actually the ew twelve which is % uh located at bugis .
alright .
so you have been to bugis , right ?
okay , now good .
so and since you are a budget travellers , you probably would like to do a little bit of using our local transport system to travel to the places you want to go , right ?
well buses will take a little bit longer time .
but train system will be a lot more comfortable because you get to enjoy the view , good view % uh while you are taking the train ride , yah .
right .
% ah do n't worry , i 'm going to go step-by-step for you .
now , you can see that the hotel is here and the train system ew twelve .
i want you to take a look carefully at ew twelve .
but ew twelve is actually bugis , right ?
it 's the bugis station .
now , i 'm gon na go to another screen where the train network system is , alright ?
alright .
can you see the train system network now ?
yah .
now you can see % uh the whole train network system here .
from changi airport , that 's where the international airport is .
where you gon na land % uh when you are coming .
so from there , the changi airport , you will have to take the train which is the east-west train .
so that 's why we call it ew % uh . ew .
so you- yah .
yes , it 's the green line you remember ?
i asked you to take a look at bugis .
okay , you locate the bugis along that green track .
right .
now if you 'll gon na take the train system from changi airport , you probably will have to end-up at this station called tanah merah which is two stops away from the changi airport .
now , you have to go across the platform to % uh switch the train towards all the way to bugis .
okay .
when you end-up in bugis , % uh the fare will be approximately about two dollars and sixty cents .
per person .
on top of that , you 'll probably will have to pay additional of one dollar extra for the deposit of the ticket .
the minute when you reach your destination , you can get your refund on the deposit of the ticket by putting the ticket into the machine .
it will get to the refund .
alright .
right .
so you will end up at bugis .
so right now i 'm gon na go back to bugis , alright .
so on your map again you can see ew twelve which is the bugis station .
yah .
so from the bugis station towards your hotel , it 's gon na be about fifteen- ten to fifteen minutes ' walk .
but if you do n't want to , you wish to take a bus , you can always take out the bus which is % uh on the map you can see some small little blue dot which are there .
those are bus stops .
you can take up any of the buses along the way which is heading toward bukit timah .
so bukit timah from rochor road all the way to bukit timah this will be the stop you 're gon na get down and walk towards your hotel nearby .
quite nearby , yah .
so this is one way you can get to your hotel and also % uh the easiest way to move around .
right .
so getting to your hotel , not a problem .
so going to little india will not be a problem for you as well because your hotel is located near to little india .
you can see that the serangoon road is here .
this serangoon road is the whole area here is known as little india .
the street which has a lot- % uh selling a lot of indian ornament and accessories .
i think your ladies friends will like % uh to shop along the street as well .
% uh now this street is very popular for it 's % uh the indian % uh what you call % uh decoration item .
you can % uh also pick it up from there , yah .
so- that depends on what you want .
in little india mainly cater for the indian taste .
right and bugis is asia .
so if you have to move towards bugis , you 'll find that % uh a lot of things you can pick it up at bugis junction , at bugis village .
so we have the
sorry ?
chocolates ?
well the- along the way towards % uh the bugis , % uh you can see there 's % uh road name call middle road .
okay , you see my mouse here ?
yah there is middle road which is there .
now this middle road % uh there is a building called gsm building .
gsm , you know the cell phone gsm ?
yah , they- and the gsm building there is a chocolate % uh what you call showroom % uh sells a lot of chocolates , yah .
so you can see- % uh let me just pull a little bit up .
okay , right .
so you can see your hotel now ?
okay , if you were to look downwards onto the % um % uh this street here , middle road , you 'll find that fortune centre is here .
next to fortune centre is where % uh the chocolate factory is .
the chocolate showroom is .
you can pick up some more chocolates here .
yah .
so it 's quite nearby and not only that ,
% uh you are also located whereby you can find lots of % uh heritage temple heritage % uh what they call % uh heritage land site here .
you can see this one here that i put mouse here , the guan yim temple .
the guan yin temple is another temple which is at the % uh- we call it a buddhist temple .
you can visit there .
% uh and if you like % uh arts % uh we have the stamford art centre showcase various kind of performing arts there .
yah .
yes indeed .
that wou~
because now nearby to your hotel there is a food court or we call it a hawker centre available also .
so you were to walk from your hotel towards this area where the % uh guan yin temple is .
there is albert centre here .
there is a lots of % uh local % uh food stall where you can find slightly better and cheaper % uh meal you can get % uh from the hawker centre .
so do must be~ right ?
at night ?
alright .
alright .
now i may- yah , so- alright .
so the hotel wise , you can see % uh nearby is the ne seven .
alright , the train six sev~ ne seven which is little india .
now the place for the nightlife is called clarke quay .
clarke quay .
you know clarke quay , right ?
okay .
so clarke quay is actually a nice place to visit during the night time .
and of course there 's a lot of seafood , % uh there are live bands , along the river bend .
% uh you can also enjoy yourself with couple of cans of beer % uh along the bridge , you know .
% uh those are the few places that you can go to clarke quay and spent the night with .
even though if you are slightly early probably you can catch our magician shows at the clarke quay called % uh the arena , yah .
the arena at the clarke quay , yah .
so % uh let me just pull this thing out for you .
% uh no it 's not coming .
let me just get the right one .
there is noti~
yah it 's not there .
% hm yes .
right .
% uh it 's not having the right map for the clarke quay .
let me see whether another one i can get .
% uh there are many of the restaurants which are located there .
% uh if you click on google , you can find it .
but i think is % uh i 'm trying to get the one which is % uh having the map of the clarke quay .
yah correct .
so you- in fact you can % uh be the- you can go there by % uh transportation through the mrt station .
the ne seven .
% uh let me then show you where i can- where you can go from here , yah .
alright now you can see % uh on the screen right now % uh little india very near to your hotel , right ?
right .
now from little india if you were to take down the train all the way down to dhoby ghaut then to clarke quay .
can you see clarke quay there ?
yah .
got it .
now- yah .
yah it 's quite near .
so you see the thing is if you choose the right hotel % uh going from one place to another is quite easy .
but % uh you also have to bear in mind that the train system only operates at five thirty in the morning and the last train leave the terminal would be at twelve midnight .
so you know clarke quay .
yes , the cab .
but the cab will charge you an additional surcharge of fifty per cent more .
yah if it 's midnight .
well it 's quite safe to walk , but then the thing is % uh you ha~ if you are drunk then % uh i advise you not .
that 's right .
so you can see % uh from here i 'm putting it up the screen it- % um reduce the screen a little bit and i try to pull this thing up here and you can- so that you can see clarke quay .
huh .
yah .
% uh the hotel is here the clarke quay .
yes it 's a little bit- % uh is- it does n't comes into the map .
yah it does n't comes into the map .
so anyway % uh the train system that you gon na get down is at clarke quay , right ?
so you can see this is clarke quay % uh train station ?
can you see clarke quay train station ?
here .
now- ne five , right ?
now % um from clarke quay % uh station , you can just walk down towards this river bank and i guess this bridge will a lot % uh more popular to you , right ?
because this is the kingsbridge whereby lots of the % uh people will be drinking bottles or cans of beer at that time using this bridge .
so it 's pretty nice % uh place to be .
% uh but of course to walk back is a little bit % uh not advisable , % huh .
yes .
hopefully not .
so best way is that if you want to back after the midnight , you probably you can % uh try to take a cab and there will , yah .
so- % uh usually i 'll go for shanghai dolly .
shanghai the , yah .
i know in fact % um it 's pub has a dancing % um , you know dancing floor .
you can drink , you can listen to lo~
how about % uh well that depends on what li~ % uh what drinks you are ordering .
right .
for example if you 're going for during the happy hour .
% uh probably you 'll buy one you 'll get the next one for free .
that start before nine .
so you have to be there before nine .
yah befo~ seven to nine .
yes .
one for one .
cool .
so you % uh % er- if you order a jug of beer , you 'll get another jug of beer free .
yah , order-
before nine .
no . now before twelve you have
huh .
yah or otherwise there is a nice place called the forbidden city .
tempting huh .
alright this % uh- in fact this forbidden city , let me just give you the forbidden city here .
yah , forbidden city .
% uh forbidden city .
alright , forbidden city at clarke quay .
indochine , yah .
here .
so this in fact % uh the forbidden city known as indochine and it 's coming up on to your screen now .
you can see the party which is happening at indochine .
you can also have your meal first , then you have drink , then you party .
well , yah .
you can see nig~
well about % uh hundred and fifty dollars i think , you should be able to make it for you .
but if you want to- if you wan na have food there , then of course it 's probably gon na be about-
as i say , you can always go during the happy hour % uh and pick it up the , what you call , the drinks before that time .
% uh that will be a lot more cheaper .
no , because your order from between seven to nine , you 'll get to- you have your drinks on your table .
and that does n't mean say you should finish it before that time .
you can leave it after that time .
so you order a drink first and for that time they will serve you the drinks , but you do n't finish it up .
you take your time to finish , enjoy the meal , music , enjoy the dance .
that should be good enough for you .
yes dolly .
dol~
yah or otherwise if you like more rocks and pops then you probably have to go to saint james powerstation .
now that is why quite near to the sentosa island and if you were to take the train towards % uh that area , % uh leads you to saint james powerstation which is % um- you can take the same train from your little india from your hotel to this .
% uh i just give you the-
% uh wait
okay .
we call it saint james powerhouse , yah .
then , right .
saint james powerhouse also have shanghai dolly .
so-
yah .
okay .
% uh now you see .
yah .
now you can see the party time ?
yes .
so these are more to hip hops and raps .
% uh you know .
so if you are going to saint james powerstation , then you get to enjoy % uh three discothèque with one admission fees .
right .
about % uh % uh twenty five dollars .
and the first drink is free .
yah .
yah .
not only for the younger crowds and it is also for middle age .
you can see that there are some other parts are there .
not really meant for the youngers , you see .
you can see that % uh the party time which is there .
these are not-
yah .
correct .
that 's right there 's % uh , yes .
there 's a live band , you know .
so it give you a variety of choice for you to choose from .
so that if you do n't like this pub % uh now you can go the other pub behind it without paying any cover charge .
yah , so that 's why-
and so let say for example if you are now enjoying yourself in a % uh pop pub right now , % uh the dancing .
then you find it % uh too much of the pounding , i ca n't take it .
so i want to go to some classical .
so you can go outta here
yah yes .
so without paying a cover charge .
but if you are going to % uh clarke quay and then % uh on different pubs , you have to pay cover charge .
alright .
so this is around about three pubs all together % uh for the price of one .
and if you like , you can probably % uh try our singapore made zero degrees tiger beer .
we call it zero degrees tiger beer .
yes , it 's very cold .
there is pudding also .
in fact i 'm a too ba~ actually i 'm not a drinker but , i have tried that particular % uh beer , the tiger beer a zero degree tiger beer .
and i find it a little bit much more comfortable .
yah .
even i 'm not a drinker but % um it give me a good sense of , you know , % uh taste .
yah .
no drink .
% uh i am i % uh- in fact i 'm allergic to alcohol .
so
yah , you can see from here on your screen right now , % um these are the few pubs which is % uh there .
and these are some of the events % uh which is happening at the pub area .
so if you wan na catch that % um % uh performance you probably come during that particular time to enjoy .
yah .
alright .
in the morning i probably suggest to you to go to singapore botanical garden .
% oh which is one of the nice place that you should not miss .
beautiful flowers , your ladies friends will love it .
yah .
yah , but % uh you need not have to worry about the weather because at most of the time % uh the weather for singapore is like there's- usually the temperature is around about twenty six degrees to thirty five , thirty six degrees .
quite humid .
the rains come and go within about an hour or two .
okay .
yah , so you need- even if you- even if the rain start to fall , it will only rain for that particular first or two hours .
that 's it .
then it goes away .
then you can go dance again .
yes correct .
and right now the screen is up for the singapore botanical garden .
right .
you can see that % um it 's free admission , so you need not have to pay .
and to get there , i 'm trying to give you % um- to get there , how to get there .
alright .
yes , alright .
yah , i guess you are happy with the free things , right ?
right .
if you were to see that % uh there are some bus service % uh which will takes you there , % uh via bukit timah , you remember the hotel that you are staying at fragrance ?
and now i just pull back this a little bit .
i just pull back to your hotel so that you can see where i 'm talking about and-
yah .
and you can see from here , right ?
this is your hotel , is n't it ?
the fragrance hotel-selegie .
now right in front of your hotel there is a bus stop .
can you see my cursor ?
right .
this bus stop is heading towards bukit timah towards your- the singapore botanical garden .
so easily you can get a bus right from there .
now the bus which is available to singapore botanical garden , which i knew of , % uh is one seven zero .
you can see bus one seven zero on the screen right now .
% uh there is the public buses , sbs buses , and that will takes you there .
probably it will cost you at the most about a dollar for the bus ride .
so the three of you would probably three dollars at the most , yah .
but % uh the what you call % uh the singapore botanical garden opens at five and it close in the middle- midnight , yah .
and of course- morning .
five a.m . in the morning .
so you-
they went for jogging- they went for jogging they jog with their dogs and they jog with their loved ones in the early morning , right .
so the park is open in the early morning and of course % uh if you go to botanical garden , then i will say that you should not miss the national orchid garden .
it 's so beautiful inside there .
we have lots of orchids there .
and of course % uh is- there are lot of % um celebrity orchids are also % um placed inside the national orchid garden .
and one of the % uh orchids that you should not miss is also nelson mandela orchid .
yah .
his name are-
right .
yes and we also have the % um your president aquino .
and that she also have a flower named after her .
inside the sa~ yah .
yah you can go there also , right ?
you can take some nice photograph of it , yah .
yah .
yes , there is .
yah .
you can see there are so many restaurants located inside the % uh botanical garden .
% uh estimated price for one lunch will probably around about twenty to thirty dollars for % uh-
yah because you are going to a restaurant .
you are not going to a food court .
yah .
% uh that is because you are having three person , right ?
% uh i see .
so i said twenty dollars per person .
% uh as i said that % uh the lunch wise , you had to put something aside like twenty five dollars to thirty dollars per person because you are dining in a restaurant .
you are not dining in a food court .
yah otherwise what you can do is you- what you can do is you can walk across the other side of the street and have hawker food .
or you can also a very cheap food there .
now let me see , i remember there is a food court available inside the botanical garden .
% oh yes .
yah .
yah .
you can see % uh there 's a food court % uh there .
just give me a minute huh the- i give you the food court here .
alright .
yah we have a new food court % uh inside the % uh singapore botanical garden .
% uh there you are .
that 's the food for thought , yah .
located in .
can you see ?
yah .
yah correct .
alright .
so these are- those are good- % uh there are good place there you can find cheap food as well , but that also depends on you di~
yah .
% uh yah .
% uh yes , i would say yes .
you should not be having any problem with that one thousand dollars unless you wan na give free drinks to everybody .
all of it .
% uh you should give a free treat to me because
okay .
no probably i should demand for ben and jerry .
ben and jerry 's .
ice cream .
yah .
yah it 's here .
you can get it from here .
right .
yah .
% uh what do yo~ what else would you want ?
i guess that one thousand dollar should be just nice for you , yah .
yah .
% uh yah because you are going to % uh pubs , % uh to have drinks , so you have to allocate that separately , yah .
yah .
okay .
okay .
yap .
no proble~ % uh okay i 'll try .
so i wait for your time to come , yah .
okay .
'cause you actually have any % uh more query you can feel free to call me again .
alright .
thank you .
bye .
